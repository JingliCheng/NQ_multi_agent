This experience and his Seventh - day Adventist upbringing reinforce Desmond 's belief in the commandment `` Thou shalt not kill '' . Years later , Doss takes an injured man to the hospital and meets a nurse , Dorothy Schutte . The two begin a relationship and Doss tells Dorothy of his interest in medical work . </P> <P> After the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor , Doss enlists in the Army and intends to serve as a combat medic . His father Tom , a troubled World War I veteran , is deeply upset by the decision . Before leaving for Fort Jackson , he asks for Dorothy 's hand in marriage and she accepts . </P> <P> Doss is placed under the command of Sergeant Howell . He excels physically but becomes an outcast among his fellow soldiers for refusing to handle a rifle and train on Saturdays . Howell and Captain Glover attempt to discharge Doss for psychiatric reasons but are overruled , as Doss ' religious beliefs do not constitute mental illness . They subsequently torment Doss by putting him through grueling labor , intending to get Doss to leave of his own accord . Despite being beaten one night by his fellow soldiers , he refuses to identify his attackers and continues training . </P> <P> Doss ' unit completes basic training and is released on leave , during which Doss intends to marry Dorothy , but his refusal to carry a firearm leads to an arrest for insubordination . Captain Glover and Dorothy visit Doss in jail and try to convince him to plead guilty so that he can be released without charge but Doss refuses to compromise his beliefs . At his trial , Doss pleads not guilty , but before he is sentenced , his father barges into the tribunal with a letter from a former commanding officer stating that his son 's pacifism is protected by an Act of Congress . The charges against Doss are dropped , and he and Dorothy are married . </P> <P> Doss ' unit is assigned to the 77th Infantry Division and deployed to the Pacific theater . During the Battle of Okinawa , Doss ' unit is informed that they are to relieve the 96th Infantry Division , which was tasked with ascending and securing the Maeda Escarpment ( `` Hacksaw Ridge '' ) . In the initial fight , both sides sustain heavy losses , and Doss successfully saves several wounded soldiers . The Americans camp for the night , which Doss spends in a foxhole with Smitty , a squadmate who was the first to call Doss a coward . Doss reveals that his aversion to holding a firearm stems from nearly shooting his drunken father , who threatened his mother with a gun . Smitty apologizes for doubting his courage and the two make amends . </P> <P> The next morning , the Japanese launch a massive counterattack and drive the Americans off the escarpment . Smitty is killed , while Howell and several of Doss ' squad mates are left injured on the battlefield . Doss hears the cries of dying soldiers and returns to save them , carrying wounded soldiers to the cliff 's edge and belaying them down by rope , each time praying to save one more . The arrival of dozens of wounded once presumed dead comes as a shock to the rest of the unit below . When day breaks , Doss rescues Howell and the two finally escape Hacksaw under enemy fire . </P> <P> Captain Glover tells Doss that the men have been inspired by his selflessness , and that they will not launch the next attack without him . Despite the next day being the Sabbath day , he joins his fellow soldiers after finishing his prayers . With reinforcements , they turn the tide of battle . During an ambush set by Japanese soldiers feigning surrender , Doss manages to save Glover and others by knocking away enemy grenades . Doss is eventually wounded by a grenade blast , but the battle is won . Doss descends the cliff , clutching the Bible Dorothy gave him . </P> <P> The film switches to archival photos and footage showing that Doss was awarded the Medal of Honor by President Harry S. Truman for rescuing 75 soldiers at Hacksaw Ridge . Doss stayed married to Dorothy until her death in 1991 . He died on March 23 , 2006 , at the age of 87 . </P> <H2> Cast ( edit ) </H2> <Ul> <Li> Andrew Garfield as Desmond Doss </Li> <Li> Vince Vaughn as Sergeant Howell </Li> <Li> Sam Worthington as Captain Jack Glover </Li> <Li> Luke Bracey as Smitty Ryker </Li> <Li> Hugo Weaving as Tom Doss , Desmond 's father </Li> <Li> Ryan Corr as Lieutenant Manville </Li> <Li> Teresa Palmer as Dorothy Schutte , Desmond 's wife </Li> <Li> Rachel Griffiths as Bertha Doss , Desmond 's mother </Li> <Li> Richard Roxburgh as Colonel Stelzer </Li> <Li> Luke Pegler as Milt `` Hollywood '' Zane </Li> <Li> Richard Pyros as Randall `` Teach '' Fuller </Li> <Li> Ben Mingay as Grease Nolan </Li> <Li> Firass Dirani as Vito Rinnelli </Li> <Li> Damien Thomlinson as Ralph Morgan </Li> <Li> Matt Nable as Lt.

Numerous producers had tried for decades to film Doss ' story , including decorated war hero Audie Murphy and Hal B. Wallis . </P> <P> In 2001 , after finally convincing Doss that making a movie on his remarkable life was the right thing to do , screenwriter / producer Gregory Crosby ( grandson of Bing Crosby ) wrote the treatment and brought the project to film producer David Permut , of Permut Presentations , through the early efforts of Stan Jensen of the Seventh - day Adventist Church , which ultimately led to the film being financed . </P> <P> In 2004 , director Terry Benedict won the rights to make a documentary about Doss , The Conscientious Objector , and secured the dramatic film rights in the process . However , Doss died in 2006 , after which producer Bill Mechanic acquired and then sold the rights to Walden Media , which developed the project along with producer David Permut . Co-producers of the film are Gregory Crosby and Steve Longi . Walden Media insisted on a PG - 13 version of the battle , and Mechanic spent years working to buy the rights back . </P> <P> After acquiring the rights , Mechanic approached Mel Gibson , and wanted him to create a concoction of violence and faith , as he did with The Passion of the Christ ( 2004 ) . Gibson turned down the offer twice , as he previously did with Braveheart ( 1995 ) . Nearly a decade later , Gibson finally agreed to direct , a decision announced in November 2014 . The same month , Andrew Garfield was confirmed to play the role of Desmond Doss . </P> <P> With a budget of $40 million , the team still faced many challenges . Hacksaw Ridge became an international co-production , with key players and firms located in both the United States and Australia . When Australian tax incentives were taken off the table , the film had to qualify as Australian to receive government subsidies . Despite being American - born , Gibson 's early years in Australia helped the film qualify , along with most of the cast being Australian , including Rachel Griffiths ( Doss ' mother ) , Teresa Palmer ( Doss ' wife ) , Sam Worthington ( unit leader ) , Hugo Weaving ( as Doss ' father ) , Richard Roxburgh ( as a colonel ) and Luke Bracey ( as Smitty , one of Doss ' most antagonistic unit members ) . Rounding out the cast was American actor Vince Vaughn . </P> <P> On February 9 , 2015 , IM Global closed a deal to finance the film , and also sold the film into the international markets . On the same day , Lionsgate acquired the North American distribution rights to the film . Chinese distribution rights were acquired by Bliss Media , a Shanghai - based film production and distribution company . </P> <P> Hacksaw Ridge is the first film directed by Gibson since Apocalypto in 2006 , and marks a departure from his previous films , such as Apocalypto and Braveheart , in which the protagonists acted violently . </P> <H3> Writing ( edit ) </H3> <P> Robert Schenkkan and Randall Wallace wrote the script , and Wallace was previously attached to direct the film . Andrew Knight polished the original script . Gibson 's partner Bruce Davey also produced the film , along with Paul Currie . </P> <H3> Casting ( edit ) </H3> <P> The cast -- Andrew Garfield , Vince Vaughn , Sam Worthington , Luke Bracey , Teresa Palmer , Rachel Griffiths , Richard Roxburgh , Luke Pegler , Richard Pyros , Ben Mingay , Firass Dirani , Nico Cortez , Michael Sheasby , Goran Kleut , Jacob Warner , Harry Greenwood , Damien Thomlinson , Ben O'Toole , Benedict Hardie , Robert Morgan , Ori Pfeffer , Milo Gibson , and Nathaniel Buzolic , Hugo Weaving , and Ryan Corr -- was announced between November 2014 and October 2015 . The younger Doss was played by Darcy Bryce . </P> <P> Garfield plays Desmond Doss , a US Army medic awarded the Medal of Honor by President Harry S. Truman for saving lives during the Battle of Okinawa in World War II . Garfield had high regards for Doss , and venerated him for his act of bravery , hailing him as a `` wonderful symbol of embodying the idea of live and let live no matter what your ideology is , no matter what your value system is , just to allow other people to be who they are and allow yourself to be who you are . '' He found the idea of playing a real superhero , as compared to his past roles playing Spider - Man in The Amazing Spider - Man and its sequel , much more inspiring . Garfield admitted that he cried the first time he read the screenplay . He visited Doss ' hometown and touched his various tools . Gibson was drawn to Garfield the first time he saw his performance in The Social Network . </P> <P> Palmer wanted a role in the film so badly that she auditioned via phone , and sent the recording to Gibson . She heard nothing back for three months , until Gibson called Palmer to tell her in a Skype chat that he had cast her in the role of Dorothy , Doss ' wife . </P> <H3> Principal photography ( edit ) </H3> <P> Principal photography started on September 29 , 2015 , and lasted for 59 days , ending in December of that year . Filming took place entirely in Australia . The film was based at Fox Studios in Sydney , after producers vigorously scouted for locations around the country . Filming took place mostly in the state of New South Wales -- where Gibson spent much of his early years -- in and around Sydney such as in Richmond , Bringelly , and Oran Park . Gibson moved to the state in July 2015 , two months before filming began . The graveyard scene was shot at a set - constructed cemetery in Sydney 's Centennial Park . The grounds of Newington Armory at Sydney Olympic Park were used as Fort Jackson . Filming in Bringelly required the team to clear and deforest over 500 hectares of land , which evoked the ire of some environmentalists . However , the producers had complete approval and clearance to do so . Also conditions were imposed to replant and rehabilitate part of the land after filming ceased . According to Troy Grant , New South Wales ' deputy premier and minister for the arts , the film brought 720 jobs and US $19 million to regional and rural New South Wales . </P> <P> Altogether , three jeeps , two trucks and a tank were featured in the film . Bulldozers and backhoes were used to transform a dairy pasture near Sydney to re-create the Okinawa battlefield . A berm had to be raised around the perimeter so cameras could turn 360 degrees without getting any eucalyptus trees in the background . Gibson did not want to rely heavily on computer visual effects , either on the screen or in pre-visualizing the battle scenes . Visual effects were used only during bloody scenes , like napalm - burnt soldiers . During filming of the war scenes , Gibson incorporated his past war - movie experiences , and would yell to the actors , reminding them constantly of what they were fighting for . </P> <H3> Post-Production ( edit ) </H3> <P> Kevin O'Connell , who won his first Academy Award for sound mixing in this film , stated that budget constraints forced him to utilize archival sounds of WWII - era weapons . </P> <H2> Themes ( edit ) </H2> <P> The film has been described as an anti-war film , with pacifist themes . It also incorporates recurring religious imagery , such as baptism and ascension . </P> <H2> Historical accuracy ( edit ) </H2> Doss on top of the Maeda Escarpment , May 4 , 1945 <P> After the war , Doss turned down many requests for books and film versions of his actions , because he was wary of whether his life , wartime experiences , and Seventh - day Adventist beliefs would be portrayed inaccurately or sensationally . Doss ' only child , Desmond Doss Jr. , stated : `` The reason he declined is that none of them adhered to his one requirement : that it be accurate . And I find it remarkable , the level of accuracy in adhering to the principal of the story in this movie . '' Producer David Permut stated that the filmmakers took great care in maintaining the integrity of the story , since Doss was very religious . </P> <P> However , the filmmakers did change some details , notably the backstory about his father , the incident with the gun Doss took out of his alcoholic father 's hands , and the circumstances of his first marriage . The character of Smitty , portrayed by Luke Bracey , is an amalgamation of various soldiers who tormented Doss and was created for narrative reasons . Other changes to the story occur near the end of the movie when Doss is placed on a stretcher . In real life , Doss had another wounded man take his place on the stretcher . After treating the soldier , a sniper shot fractured Doss ' arm and he crawled to safety after being left alone for five hours . Gibson omitted this from the film because he felt that the audience would not find the scene believable . The film also omits his prior combat service in the Battle of Guam and Battle of Leyte ( Doss was awarded the Bronze Star Medal for extraordinary bravery in both battles ) , and leaves the impression that Doss ' actions at Okinawa took place over a period of a few days , though his Medal of Honor citation covered his actions over a period of about three weeks ( April 29 to May 21 ) . </P> <H2> Music ( edit ) </H2> The film 's score was recorded at Abbey Road Studios in London . <Table> <Tr> <Th_colspan=\"2\"> Hacksaw Ridge : Original Motion Picture Soundtrack </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Th_colspan=\"2\"> Soundtrack album by Rupert Gregson - Williams </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Released </Th> <Td> November 4 , 2016 ( 2016 - 11 - 04 ) </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Recorded </Th> <Td> 2016 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Studio </Th> <Td> Abbey Road Studios </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Genre </Th> <Td> Film score </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Length </Th> <Td> 53 : 56 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Label </Th> <Td> Varèse Sarabande </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Producer </Th> <Td> Rupert Gregson - Williams </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td_colspan=\"2\"> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th_colspan=\"2\"> Rupert Gregson - Williams chronology </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td_colspan=\"2\"> <Table> <Tr> <Td> The Legend of Tarzan : Original Motion Picture Soundtrack ( 2016 ) </Td> <Td> Hacksaw Ridge : Original Motion Picture Soundtrack ( 2016 ) </Td> <Td> Sandy Wexler : Original Motion Picture Soundtrack ( 2017 ) </Td> </Tr> </Table> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td_colspan=\"2\"> </Td> </Tr> </Table> <P> James Horner was originally approached to compose the score for the film but was replaced by John Debney after Horner 's untimely death in 2015 .

When composing the music Gregson - Williams commented : `` The soundtrack is really in two parts . A lovely romance blossoms as Desmond discovers both the love of his life and his faith . The second half of the movie is brutal ... We wanted to reflect his spirituality without being pious , and his bravery without celebrating violence .

( December 2017 ) </Td> </Tr> </Table> <P> In August 2016 , Gibson appeared at Pastor Greg Laurie 's SoCal Harvest in Anaheim , California , to promote the film . </P> <H2> Reception ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Box Office ( edit ) </H3> <P> Hacksaw Ridge grossed $67.1 million in the United States and Canada and $108.2 million in other countries for a worldwide total of $175.3 million , against a production budget of $40 million . </P> <P> The film opened alongside Doctor Strange and Trolls , and was projected to gross around $12 million from 2,886 theaters . It was expected to play very well among faith - based , Midwest , and Southern audiences . It made $5.2 million on its first day and $15.2 million in its opening weekend , finishing third at the box office behind Doctor Strange and Trolls . The debut was on par with the $15 million opening of Gibson 's last directorial effort , Apocalypto , in 2006 . In its second weekend , the film grossed $10.8 million ( a drop of just 29.1 % ) , finishing 5th at the box office . </P> <P> The film also opened successfully in China , grossing over $16 million in its first four days at the box office . </P> <H3> Critical response ( edit ) </H3> <P> On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes , the film has an approval rating of 86 % based on 244 reviews , with an average rating of 7.2 / 10 . The site 's critical consensus reads , `` Hacksaw Ridge uses a real - life pacifist 's legacy to lay the groundwork for a gripping wartime tribute to faith , valor , and the courage of remaining true to one 's convictions . '' On Metacritic , the film has a weighted average score of 71 out of 100 , based on 47 critics , indicating `` generally favorable reviews '' . Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave an average grade of `` A '' on an A+ to F scale . </P> <P> The Milford Daily News called the film a `` masterpiece '' , adding that it `` is going to end up on many 2016 Top 10 lists , that should get Oscar nominations for Best Actor , Best Director and Best Picture . '' Maggie Stancu of Movie Pilot wrote that `` Gibson made some of his most genius directing choices in Hacksaw Ridge , and Garfield has given his best performance yet . With amazing performances by Vince Vaughn , Teresa Palmer , Sam Worthington and Hugo Weaving , it is absolutely one of 2016 's must - see films . '' Mick LaSalle of SFGate called the film `` a brilliant return for Mel Gibson , which confirms his position as a director with a singular talent for spectacle and a sure way with actors . '' In The Film Lawyers , Samar Khan called Hacksaw Ridge `` fantastic , '' and emphasised `` just how wonderful it is to have Gibson back in a more prominent position in Hollywood , hopefully with the demons of his past behind him . If Hacksaw Ridge is any indication , we are poised for a future filled with great films from the visionary director . '' The Daily Telegraph awarded four stars , and added : `` Hacksaw Ridge is a fantastically moving and bruising war film that hits you like a raw topside of beef in the face -- a kind of primary - coloured Guernica that flourishes on a big screen with a crowd . '' </P> <P> The Guardian also awarded the film four stars , and stated that Gibson had `` absolutely hit Hacksaw Ridge out of the park . '' The Australian 's reviewer was equally positive , stating that , as a director , `` Gibson 's approach is bold and fearless ; this represents his best work to date behind the camera . '' Rex Reed of Observer rated it with four stars , and called it `` the best war film since Saving Private Ryan ... ( I ) t is violent , harrowing , heartbreaking and unforgettable . And yes , it was directed by Mel Gibson . He deserves a medal , too '' Michael Smith of Tulsa World called Hacksaw Ridge a `` moving character study '' and praised both the direction and acting : `` It 's truly remarkable how Gibson can film scenes of such heartfelt emotion with such sweet subtlety as easily as he stages some of the most vicious , visual scenes of violence that you will ever see ... Hacksaw Ridge is beautiful and brutal , and that 's a potent combination for a movie about a man determined to serve his country , as well as his soul . '' IGN critic Alex Welch gave a score of 8 / 10 , praising it as `` one of the most successful war films of recent memory , '' and `` at times horrifying , inspiring , and heart - wrenching . '' Mike Ryan of Uproxx gave the film a positive review , praising Gibson 's direction and saying , `` There are two moments during the second half of Mel Gibson 's Hacksaw Ridge when I literally jumped out of my seat in terror . The film 's depiction of war is the best I 've seen since Saving Private Ryan . '' Peter Travers of Rolling Stone gave the film 3.5 stars , writing , `` Thanks to some of the greatest battle scenes ever filmed , Gibson once again shows his staggering gifts as a filmmaker , able to juxtapose savagery with aching tenderness . '' In contrast , Matt Zoller Seitz for RogerEbert.com gave the film 2.5 stars , and described the film as `` a movie at war with itself .

These countries were all allies in World War II , which they won . They are also all nuclear weapons states . A total of 15 UN member states serve on the UNSC , the remainder of which are elected .

There have been two seat changes since then , although not reflected in Article 23 of the United Nations Charter as it has not been accordingly amended : </P> Leaders of the five permanent member states at a summit in 2000 . Clockwise from front left : Chinese President Jiang Zemin , U.S. President Bill Clinton , UK Prime Minister Tony Blair , Russian President Vladimir Putin , and French President Jacques Chirac . <Ul> <Li> China 's seat was originally held by the Nationalist government of the Republic of China . However , it lost the Chinese Civil War and retreated to the island of Taiwan in 1949 . The Communist Party won control of mainland China and established the People 's Republic of China . In 1971 , UN General Assembly Resolution 2758 recognized the Government of People 's Republic of China as the legal representative of China in the UN , and gave it the seat on the Security Council that had been held by the Republic of China , which was expelled from the UN altogether . Both governments still officially claim one another 's territory . However , only 20 states continue to officially recognize the Republic of China 's sovereignty . </Li> <Li> After the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991 , Russia was recognized as the legal successor state of the Soviet Union and maintained the latter 's position on the Security Council . </Li> </Ul> <P> Additionally , France reformed its provisional government into the French Fourth Republic in 1946 and later into the French Fifth Republic in 1958 , both under the leadership of Charles de Gaulle . France maintained its seat as there was no change in its international status or recognition , although many of its overseas possessions eventually became independent . </P> <P> The five permanent members of the Security Council were the victorious powers in World War II and have maintained the world 's most powerful military forces ever since . They annually top the list of countries with the highest military expenditures ; in 2011 , they spent over US $ 1 trillion combined on defense , accounting for over 60 % of global military expenditures ( the U.S. alone accounting for over 40 % ) . They are also five of the world 's six largest arms exporters , along with Germany and are the only nations officially recognized as `` nuclear - weapon states '' under the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons ( NPT ) , though there are other states known or believed to be in possession of nuclear weapons . </P> <H3> Veto power ( edit ) </H3> Main article : United Nations Security Council veto power <P> The `` power of veto '' refers to the veto power wielded solely by the permanent members , enabling them to prevent the adoption of any `` substantive '' draft Council resolution , regardless of the level of international support for the draft . The veto does not apply to procedural votes , which is significant in that the Security Council 's permanent membership can vote against a `` procedural '' draft resolution , without necessarily blocking its adoption by the Council . </P> <P> The veto is exercised when any permanent member -- the so - called `` P5 '' -- casts a `` negative '' vote on a `` substantive '' draft resolution . Abstention or absence from the vote by a permanent member does not prevent a draft resolution from being adopted . </P> <H2> Expansion ( edit ) </H2> Main article : Reform of the United Nations Security Council The G4 nations that support one another 's bids for permanent seats on the UN Security Council <P> There have been proposals suggesting the introduction of new permanent members . The candidates usually mentioned are Brazil , Germany , India , and Japan . They comprise the group of four countries known as the G4 nations , which mutually support one another 's bids for permanent seats . </P> <P> This sort of reform has traditionally been opposed by the `` Uniting for Consensus '' group , which is composed primarily of nations that are regional rivals and economic competitors of the G4 . The group is led by Italy and Spain ( opposing Germany ) , Mexico , Colombia , and Argentina ( opposing Brazil ) , and South Korea ( opposing Japan ) , in addition to Turkey , Indonesia and others . Since 1992 , Italy and other council members have instead proposed semi-permanent seats or expanding the number of temporary seats . </P> <P> Most of the leading candidates for permanent membership are regularly elected onto the Security Council by their respective groups . Japan was elected for eleven two - year terms , Brazil for ten terms , and Germany for three terms . India has been elected to the council seven times in total , with the most recent successful bid being in 2010 after a gap of almost twenty years since 1991 -- 92 . </P> <P> In 2013 , the P5 and G4 members of the UN Security Council accounted for eight of the world 's ten largest defense budgets , according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute ( SIPRI ) . </P> <H2> Current leaders of the permanent members ( edit ) </H2> <P> The following are the heads of state and government that represent the permanent members of the UN Security Council as of 2018 : </P> <Ul> <Li> <P> Xi Jinping President of the People 's Republic of China since 14 March 2013 ( General Secretary as de facto leader since 15 November 2012 ) </P> </Li> <Li> <P> Emmanuel Macron President of the French Republic since 14 May 2017 </P> </Li> <Li> <P> Vladimir Putin President of the Russian Federation since 7 May 2012 ( de facto leader since 7 May 2000 ) </P> </Li> <Li> <P> Theresa May Prime Minister of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland since 13 July 2016 </P> </Li> <Li> <P> Donald Trump President of the United States of America since 20 January 2017 </P> </Li> </Ul> <H2> See also ( edit ) </H2> <Ul> <Li> List of country groupings </Li> </Ul> <H2> Notes ( edit ) </H2> <Ol> <Li> ^ Jump up to : The de jure head of government of China is the Premier , whose current holder is Li Keqiang .

It became an autonomous body by The Government of India on 12 April 1992 and given statutory powers in 1992 with SEBI Act 1992 being passed by the Indian Parliament . SEBI has its headquarters at the business district of Bandra Kurla Complex in Mumbai , and has Northern , Eastern , Southern and Western Regional Offices in New Delhi , Kolkata , Chennai and Ahmedabad respectively . It has opened local offices at Jaipur and Bangalore and is planning to open offices at Guwahati , Bhubaneshwar , Patna , Kochi and Chandigarh in Financial Year 2013 - 2014 . </P> <P> Controller of Capital Issues was the regulatory authority before SEBI came into existence ; it derived authority from the Capital Issues ( Control ) Act , 1947 . </P> <P> Initially SEBI was a non statutory body without any statutory power . However , in 1992 , the SEBI was given additional statutory power by the Government of India through an amendment to the Securities and Exchange Board of India Act , 1992 . In April 1988 the SEBI was constituted as the regulator of capital markets in India under a resolution of the Government of India . The SEBI is managed by its members , which consists of following : </P> <P> The chairman who is nominated by Union Government of India. Two members , i.e. , Officers from Union Finance Ministry .

Dave </Td> <Td> 12 April 1988 </Td> <Td> 23 August 1990 </Td> </Tr> </Table> <H2> Functions and responsibilities ( edit ) </H2> <P> The Preamble of the Securities and Exchange Board of India describes the basic functions of the Securities and Exchange Board of India as `` ... to protect the interests of investors in securities and to promote the development of , and to regulate the securities market and for matters connected there with or incidental there to '' . </P> <P> SEBI has to be responsive to the needs of three groups , which constitute the market : </P> <Ul> <Li> the issuers of securities </Li> <Li> the investors </Li> <Li> the market intermediaries . </Li> </Ul> <P> SEBI has three functions rolled into one body : quasi-legislative , quasi-judicial and quasi-executive . It drafts regulations in its legislative capacity , it conducts investigation and enforcement action in its executive function and it passes rulings and orders in its judicial capacity . Though this makes it very powerful , there is an appeal process to create accountability . There is a Securities Appellate Tribunal which is a three - member tribunal and is headed by Mr. Justice JP Devadhar , a former judge of the Bombay High Court . A second appeal lies directly to the Supreme Court . SEBI has taken a very proactive role in streamlining disclosure requirements to international standards . </P> <H3> Powers ( edit ) </H3> <P> For the discharge of its functions efficiently , SEBI has been vested with the following powers : </P> <Ol> <Li> to approve by − laws of Securities exchanges . </Li> <Li> to require the Securities exchange to amend their by − laws . </Li> <Li> inspect the books of accounts and call for periodical returns from recognized Securities exchanges . </Li> <Li> inspect the books of accounts of financial intermediaries . </Li> <Li> compel certain companies to list their shares in one or more Securities exchanges . </Li> <Li> registration broke </Li> </Ol> <P> There are two types of brokers : </P> <Ol> <Li> Discount Brokers </Li> <Li> Merchant Brokers </Li> </Ol> <P> SEBI committees </P> <Ol> <Li> Technical Advisory Committee </Li> <Li> Committee for review of structure of market infrastructure institutions </Li> <Li> Advisory Committee for the SEBI Investor Protection and Education Fund </Li> <Li> Takeover Regulations Advisory Committee </Li> <Li> Primary Market Advisory Committee ( PMAC ) </Li> <Li> Secondary Market Advisory Committee ( SMAC ) </Li> <Li> Mutual Fund Advisory Committee </Li> <Li> Corporate Bonds & Securitization Advisory Committee </Li> </Ol> <H2> Major achievements ( edit ) </H2> <P> SEBI has enjoyed success as a regulator by pushing systematic reforms aggressively and successively . SEBI is credited for quick movement towards making the markets electronic and paperless by introducing T + 5 rolling cycle from July 2001 and T + 3 in April 2002 and further to T + 2 in April 2003 . The rolling cycle of T + 2 means , Settlement is done in 2 days after Trade date . SEBI has been active in setting up the regulations as required under law . SEBI did away with physical certificates that were prone to postal delays , theft and forgery , apart from making the settlement process slow and cumbersome by passing Depositories Act , 1996 . </P> <P> SEBI has also been instrumental in taking quick and effective steps in light of the global meltdown and the Satyam fiasco . In October 2011 , it increased the extent and quantity of disclosures to be made by Indian corporate promoters . In light of the global meltdown , it liberalised the takeover code to facilitate investments by removing regulatory structures . In one such move , SEBI has increased the application limit for retail investors to ₹ 2 lakh , from ₹ 1 lakh at present . </P> <H2> Controversies ( edit ) </H2> <P> Supreme Court of India heard a Public Interest Litigation ( PIL ) filed by India Rejuvenation Initiative that had challenged the procedure for key appointments adopted by Govt of India . The petition alleged that , `` The constitution of the search - cum - selection committee for recommending the name of chairman and every whole - time members of SEBI for appointment has been altered , which directly impacted its balance and could compromise the role of the SEBI as a watchdog . '' On 21 November 2011 , the court allowed petitioners to withdraw the petition and file a fresh petition pointing out constitutional issues regarding appointments of regulators and their independence . The Chief Justice of India refused the finance ministry 's request to dismiss the PIL and said that the court was well aware of what was going on in SEBI . Hearing a similar petition filed by Bengaluru - based advocate Anil Kumar Agarwal , a two judge Supreme Court bench of Justice SS Nijjar and Justice HL Gokhale issued a notice to the Govt of India , SEBI chief UK Sinha and Omita Paul , Secretary to the ( President of India ) . </P> <P> Further , it came into light that Dr KM Abraham ( the then whole time member of SEBI Board ) had written to the Prime Minister about malaise in SEBI . He said , `` The regulatory institution is under duress and under severe attack from powerful corporate interests operating concertedly to undermine SEBI '' . He specifically said that Finance Minister 's office , and especially his advisor Omita Paul , were trying to influence many cases before SEBI , including those relating to Sahara Group , Reliance , Bank of Rajasthan and MCX. ... </P> <H2> SEBI and regional Securities exchanges ( edit ) </H2> <P> SEBI in its circular dated May 30 , 2012 gave exit - guidelines for Securities exchanges . This was mainly due to illiquid nature of trade on many of 20 + regional Securities exchanges . It had asked many of these exchanges to either meet the required criteria or take a graceful exit . SEBI 's new norms for Securities exchanges mandates that it should have minimum net - worth of Rs. 100 crore and an annual trading of Rs. 1,000 crore . The Indian Securities market regulator SEBI had given the recognized Securities exchanges two years to comply or exit the business . </P> <H3> Process of de-recognition and exit : ( edit ) </H3> <P> Following is an excerpts from the circular </P> <P> 1. Exchanges may seek exit through voluntary surrender of recognition . </P> <P> 2. Securities where the annual trading turnover on its own platform is less than Rs 1000 Crore can apply to SEBI for voluntary surrender of recognition and exit , at any time before the expiry of two years from the date of issuance of this Circular . </P> <P> 3. If the Securities exchange is not able to achieve the prescribed turnover of Rs 1000 Crores on continuous basis or does not apply for voluntary surrender of recognition and exit before the expiry of two years from the date of this Circular , SEBI shall proceed with compulsory de-recognition and exit of such Securities exchanges , in terms of the conditions as may be specified by SEBI . </P> <P> 4. Securities Exchanges which are already de-recognised as on date , shall make an application for exit within two months from the date of this circular . Upon failure to do so , the de-recognized exchange shall be subject to compulsory exit process . </P> <H2> See also ( edit ) </H2> <Ul> <Li> National Securities Exchange of India </Li> <Li> Forward Markets Commission ( India ) </Li> <Li> Securities Commission </Li> <Li> Financial regulation </Li> <Li> List of financial regulatory authorities by country </Li> <Li> Securities exchange </Li> <Li> Regulation D ( SEC ) </Li> <Li> Institute of Chartered Accountants of India </Li> <Li> Institute of Company Secretaries of India </Li> <Li> List of stock exchanges in the Commonwealth of Nations </Li> </Ul> <H2> References ( edit ) </H2> <Ol> <Li> ^ Jump up to : `` About SEBI '' .

The city , located in northern China , is governed as a direct - controlled municipality under the national government with 16 urban , suburban , and rural districts . Beijing Municipality is surrounded by Hebei Province with the exception of neighboring Tianjin Municipality to the southeast ; together the three divisions form the Jingjinji metropolitan region and the national capital region of China . </P> <P> As a city combining both modern and traditional architecture , Beijing is an ever - changing megacity rich in history but also truly modern , exemplified in its global influence in politics , business & economy , education , history , culture , language , music , sporting , architecture , civilization , fashion , art , entertainment , innovation , and technology . Beijing is the second largest Chinese city by urban population after Shanghai and is the nation 's political , cultural , and educational center . It is home to the headquarters of most of China 's largest state - owned companies and is a major hub for the national highway , expressway , railway , and high - speed rail networks . The Beijing Capital International Airport has been the second busiest in the world by passenger traffic since 2010 , and , as of 2016 , the city 's subway network is the busiest and second longest in the world , after Shanghai 's subway system . </P> <P> The city 's history dates back three millennia . As the last of the Four Great Ancient Capitals of China , Beijing has been the political center of the country for much of the past eight centuries . With mountains surrounding the inland city on three sides , in addition to the old inner and outer city walls , Beijing was strategically poised and developed to be the residence of the emperor and thus was the perfect location for the imperial capital . Beijing was the largest city in the world by population for much of the second millennium A.D. The city is renowned for its opulent palaces , temples , parks , gardens , tombs , walls and gates . Its art treasures and universities have made it center of culture and art in China . Encyclopædia Britannica notes that `` few cities in the world have served for so long as the political headquarters and cultural centre of an area as immense as China . '' Beijing has seven UNESCO World Heritage Sites -- the Forbidden City , Temple of Heaven , Summer Palace , Ming Tombs , Zhoukoudian , as well as parts of the Great Wall and the Grand Canal , all popular locations for tourism . Siheyuans , the city 's traditional housing style , and hutongs , the narrow alleys between siheyuans , are major tourist attractions and are common in urban Beijing . The city hosted the 2008 Summer Olympics and was chosen to host the 2022 Winter Olympics , making it the first city to ever host both Winter and Summer Olympics . </P> <P> Many of Beijing 's 91 universities consistently rank among the best in China , of which Peking University and Tsinghua University are ranked in the top 60 universities of the world . In 2015 , 52 companies of the Fortune Global 500 company headquarters were located in Beijing , more than any other city in the world , including state - owned enterprises State Grid , China National Petroleum , and Sinopec Group , ranked 2nd , 3rd , and 4th , respectively . Beijing CBD is quickly becoming the center for Beijing 's economic expansion , rapid modernization , and radically changing skyline , with the ongoing or recently completed construction of multiple skyscrapers . Beijing 's Zhongguancun area is also known as China 's Silicon Valley and China 's center of innovation and technology entrepreneurship . According to the 2016 InterNations Expat Insider Survey , Beijing ranked first in Asia in the subcategory `` Personal Finance Index , '' a measure of expats ' salaries versus cost of living in the city . Expats live primarily in urban districts such as Dongcheng and Chaoyang in the east , or in suburban districts such as Shunyi . </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Etymology </Li> <Li> 2 History <Ul> <Li> 2.1 Early history </Li> <Li> 2.2 Early Imperial China </Li> <Li> 2.3 Ming dynasty </Li> <Li> 2.4 Qing dynasty </Li> <Li> 2.5 Republic of China </Li> <Li> 2.6 People 's Republic of China </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 3 Geography <Ul> <Li> 3.1 Climate </Li> <Li> 3.2 Environmental problems <Ul> <Li> 3.2. 1 Air quality <Ul> <Li> 3.2. 1.1 Readings </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 3.2. 2 Dust storms </Li> </Ul> </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 4 Politics and government <Ul> <Li> 4.1 Administrative divisions <Ul> <Li> 4.1. 1 Towns </Li> <Li> 4.1. 2 Neighborhoods </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 4.2 Judiciary and procuracy </Li> <Li> 4.3 Diplomatic missions </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 5 Economy <Ul> <Li> 5.1 Sector composition </Li> <Li> 5.2 Economic zones </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 6 Demographics </Li> <Li> 7 Culture <Ul> <Li> 7.1 Places of interest </Li> <Li> 7.2 Architecture </Li> <Li> 7.3 Religion <Ul> <Li> 7.3. 1 Chinese folk religion and Taoism </Li> <Li> 7.3. 2 Buddhism </Li> <Li> 7.3. 3 Islam </Li> <Li> 7.3. 4 Christianity <Ul> <Li> 7.3. 4.1 Catholicism </Li> <Li> 7.3. 4.2 Protestantism </Li> <Li> 7.3. 4.3 Eastern Orthodox </Li> </Ul> </Li> </Ul> </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 8 Media <Ul> <Li> 8.1 Television and radio </Li> <Li> 8.2 Press </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 9 Sports <Ul> <Li> 9.1 Events </Li> <Li> 9.2 Venues </Li> <Li> 9.3 Clubs </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 10 Transportation <Ul> <Li> 10.1 Rail and high - speed rail </Li> <Li> 10.2 Roads and expressways </Li> <Li> 10.3 Air </Li> <Li> 10.4 Public transit </Li> <Li> 10.5 Taxi </Li> <Li> 10.6 Bicycles </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 11 Defense and aerospace </Li> <Li> 12 Nature and wildlife </Li> <Li> 13 See also </Li> <Li> 14 References </Li> <Li> 15 Further reading </Li> <Li> 16 External links </Li> </Ul> <H2> Etymology ( edit ) </H2> See also : Names of Beijing <P> Over the past 3,000 years , the city of Beijing has had numerous other names . The name Beijing , which means `` Northern Capital '' ( from the Chinese characters 北 for north and 京 for capital ) , was applied to the city in 1403 during the Ming Dynasty to distinguish the city from Nanjing ( the `` Southern Capital '' ) . The English spelling is based on the pinyin romanization of the two characters as they are pronounced in Standard Mandarin . An older English spelling , Peking , is the postal romanization of the same two characters as they are pronounced in Chinese dialects spoken in the southern port towns first visited by European traders and missionaries . Those dialects preserve the Middle Chinese pronunciation of 京 as kjaeng , prior to a phonetic shift in the northern dialects to the modern pronunciation . Although Peking is no longer the common name for the city , some of the city 's older locations and facilities , such as Beijing Capital International Airport , with IATA Code PEK , and Peking University , still use the former romanization . </P> <P> The single Chinese character abbreviation for Beijing is 京 , which appears on automobile license plates in the city . The official Latin alphabet abbreviation for Beijing is `` BJ '' . </P> <H2> History ( edit ) </H2> Main article : History of Beijing <H3> Early History ( edit ) </H3> <P> The earliest traces of human habitation in the Beijing municipality were found in the caves of Dragon Bone Hill near the village of Zhoukoudian in Fangshan District , where Peking Man lived . Homo erectus fossils from the caves date to 230,000 to 250,000 years ago . Paleolithic Homo sapiens also lived there more recently , about 27,000 years ago . Archaeologists have found neolithic settlements throughout the municipality , including in Wangfujing , located in downtown Beijing . </P> <P> The first walled city in Beijing was Ji , a city from the 11th to 7th century BC . Within modern Beijing , Ji was located around the present Guang'anmen area in the south of Xicheng District . This settlement was later conquered by the state of Yan and made its capital under the name Yanjing . </P> <H3> Early Imperial China ( edit ) </H3> The Tianning Pagoda , built around 1120 during the Liao dynasty . <P> After the First Emperor unified China , Beijing became a prefectural capital for the region . During the Three Kingdoms period , it was held by Gongsun Zan and Yuan Shao before falling to Cao Cao 's Wei Kingdom . The AD 3rd - century Western Jin demoted the town , placing the prefectural seat in neighboring Zhuozhou . </P> <P> During the Sixteen Kingdoms period when northern China was conquered and divided by the Wu Hu , Beijing , as Jicheng , was briefly the capital of the Xianbei Former Yan Kingdom . </P> <P> After China was reunified during the Sui Dynasty , Beijing , known as Zhuojun , became the northern terminus of the Grand Canal . Under the Tang Dynasty , Beijing as Fanyang , served as a military frontier command center . During the An - Shi Rebellion and again amidst the turmoil of the late Tang , local military commanders founded their own short - lived Yan Dynasties and called the city Yanjing , or the `` Yan Capital . '' In 938 , after the fall of the Tang , the Later Jin ceded the entire northern frontier to the Khitan Liao Dynasty , which renamed the city Nanjing , or the `` Southern Capital '' , one of four secondary capitals to complement its `` Supreme Capital '' , Shangjing ( modern Baarin Left Banner in Inner Mongolia ) . Some of the oldest surviving structures in Beijing date to the Liao period , including the Tianning Pagoda . </P> Longevity Hill in Beijing where Kublai Khan wrote his poem . <P> The Liao fell to the Jurchen Jin dynasty in 1122 , which gave the city to the Song Dynasty and then retook it in 1125 during its conquest of northern China . In 1153 , the Jurchen Jin made Beijing their `` Central Capital '' , called Zhongdu . The city was besieged by Genghis Khan 's invading Mongolian army in 1213 and razed to the ground two years later . Two generations later , Kublai Khan ordered the construction of Dadu ( or Daidu to the Mongols , commonly known as Khanbaliq ) , a new capital for his Yuan dynasty to be located adjacent to the Jurchen Jin ruins . The construction took from 1264 to 1293 , but greatly enhanced the status of a city on the northern fringe of China proper . The city was centered on the Drum Tower slightly to the north of modern Beijing and stretched from the present - day Chang'an Avenue to the Line 10 subway . Remnants of the Yuan rammed earth wall still stand and are known as the Tucheng . </P> <H3> Ming Dynasty ( edit ) </H3> One of the corner towers of the Forbidden City . <P> In 1368 , soon after declaring the new Hongwu era of the Ming dynasty , the rebel leader Zhu Yuanzhang sent an army to Khanbaliq and conquered it . Since the Yuan continued to occupy Shangdu and Mongolia , however , a new town was established to supply the military garrisons in the area . This was called Beiping and under the Hongwu Emperor 's feudal policies it was given to Zhu Di , one of his sons , who was created `` Prince of Yan '' . </P> <P> The early death of Zhu Yuanzhang 's heir led to a succession struggle on his death , one that ended with the victory of Zhu Di and the declaration of the new Yongle era . Since his harsh treatment of the Ming capital Yingtian ( modern Nanjing ) alienated many there , he established his fief as a new co-capital . The city of Beiping became Shuntian in 1403 . The construction of the new imperial residence , the Forbidden City , took from 1406 to 1420 ; this period was also responsible for several other of the modern city 's major attractions , such as the Temple of Heaven and Tian'anmen ( although the square facing it was not cleared until 1651 ) . On 28 October 1420 , the city was officially designated the capital of the Ming Dynasty in the same year that the Forbidden City was completed . Beijing became the empire 's primary capital ( Jingshi ) and Yingtian -- or called Nanjing -- became the co-capital . ( A 1425 order by Zhu Di 's son , the Hongxi Emperor , to return the capital to Nanjing was never carried out : he died , probably of a heart attack , the next month . He was buried , like almost every Ming emperor to follow him , in an elaborate necropolis to Beijing 's north . ) </P> <P> By the 15th century , Beijing had essentially taken its current shape . The Ming city wall continued to serve until modern times , when it was pulled down and the 2nd Ring Road was built in its place . It is generally believed that Beijing was the largest city in the world for most of the 15th , 16th , 17th , and 18th centuries . The first known church was constructed by Catholics in 1652 at the former site of Matteo Ricci 's chapel ; the modern Nantang Cathedral was later built upon the same site . </P> <P> The capture of Beijing by Li Zicheng 's peasant army in 1644 ended the dynasty , but he and his Shun court abandoned the city without a fight when the Manchu army of Prince Dorgon arrived 40 days later . </P> <H3> Qing Dynasty ( edit ) </H3> A Pekingese chiropodist . John Thomson . China , 1869 . The Wellcome Collection , London Chongwenmen , a gate to the inner walled city , c. 1906 <P> Dorgon established the Qing Dynasty as a direct successor of the Ming ( delegitimising Li Zicheng and his followers ) and Beijing became China 's sole capital . The Qing emperors made some modifications to the Imperial residence but , in large part , the Ming buildings and the general layout remained unchanged . Facilities for Manchu worship were introduced , but the Qing also continued the traditional state rituals . Signage was bilingual or Chinese . This early Qing Beijing later formed the setting for the Chinese novel Dream of the Red Chamber . </P> <P> During the Second Opium War , Anglo - French forces captured the city , looting and burning the Old Summer Palace in 1860 . Under the Convention of Peking ending that war , Western powers for the first time secured the right to establish permanent diplomatic presences within the city . In 1900 , the attempt by the `` Boxers '' to eradicate this presence , as well as Chinese Christian converts , led to Beijing 's reoccupation by foreign powers . During the fighting , several important structures were destroyed , including the Hanlin Academy and the ( new ) Summer Palace . </P> <H3> Republic of China ( edit ) </H3> Play media Beijing filmed in 1937 <P> The fomenters of the Xinhai Revolution of 1911 sought to replace Qing rule with a republic and leaders like Sun Yat - sen originally intended to return the capital to Nanjing . After the Qing general Yuan Shikai forced the abdication of the last Qing emperor and ensured the success of the revolution , the revolutionaries accepted him as president of the new Republic of China . Yuan maintained his capital at Beijing and quickly consolidated power , declaring himself emperor in 1915 . His death less than a year later left China under the control of the warlords commanding the regional armies . Following the success of the Nationalists ' Northern Expedition , the capital was formally removed to Nanjing in 1928 . On 28 June the same year , Beijing 's name was returned to Beiping ( written at the time as `` Peiping '' ) . </P> <P> During the Second Sino - Japanese War , Beiping fell to Japan on 29 July 1937 and was made the seat of the Provisional Government of the Republic of China , a puppet state that ruled the ethnic - Chinese portions of Japanese - occupied northern China . This government was later merged into the larger Wang Jingwei government based in Nanjing . </P> <H3> People 's Republic of China ( edit ) </H3> Mao Zedong proclaiming the establishment of the People 's Republic of China in 1949 <P> In the final phases of the Chinese Civil War , the People 's Liberation Army seized control of the city peacefully on 31 January 1949 in the course of the Pingjin Campaign . On 1 October that year , Mao Zedong announced the creation of the People 's Republic of China from atop Tian'anmen . He restored the name of the city , as the new capital , to Beijing , a decision that had been reached by the Chinese People 's Political Consultative Conference just a few days earlier . </P> <P> In the 1950s , the city began to expand beyond the old walled city and its surrounding neighborhoods , with heavy industries in the west and residential neighborhoods in the north . Many areas of the Beijing city wall were torn down in the 1960s to make way for the construction of the Beijing Subway and the 2nd Ring Road . </P> A scene from the opening ceremonies of the 2008 Summer Olympic Games . <P> During the Cultural Revolution from 1966 to 1976 , the Red Guard movement began in Beijing and the city 's government fell victim to one of the first purges . By the fall of 1966 , all city schools were shut down and over a million Red Guards from across the country gathered in Beijing for eight rallies in Tian'anmen Square with Mao . In April 1976 , a large public gathering of Beijing residents against the Gang of Four and the Cultural Revolution in Tiananmen Square was forcefully suppressed . In October 1976 , the Gang was arrested in Zhongnanhai and the Cultural Revolution came to an end . In December 1978 , the Third Plenum of the 11th Party Congress in Beijing under the leadership of Deng Xiaoping reversed the verdicts against victims of the Cultural Revolution and instituted the `` policy of reform and opening up . '' </P> <P> Since the early 1980s , the urban area of Beijing has expanded greatly with the completion of the 2nd Ring Road in 1981 and the subsequent addition of the 3rd , 4th , 5th and 6th Ring Roads . According to one 2005 newspaper report , the size of newly developed Beijing was one - and - a-half times larger than before . Wangfujing and Xidan have developed into flourishing shopping districts , while Zhongguancun has become a major center of electronics in China . In recent years , the expansion of Beijing has also brought to the forefront some problems of urbanization , such as heavy traffic , poor air quality , the loss of historic neighborhoods , and a significant influx of migrant workers from less - developed rural areas of the country . Beijing has also been the location of many significant events in recent Chinese history , principally the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989 . The city has also hosted major international events , including the 2008 Summer Olympics and the 2015 World Championships in Athletics . </P> <H2> Geography ( edit ) </H2> Main article : Geography of Beijing Landsat 7 Satellite image of Beijing Municipality with the surrounding mountains in dark brown <P> Beijing is situated at the northern tip of the roughly triangular North China Plain , which opens to the south and east of the city . Mountains to the north , northwest and west shield the city and northern China 's agricultural heartland from the encroaching desert steppes . The northwestern part of the municipality , especially Yanqing County and Huairou District , are dominated by the Jundu Mountains , while the western part is framed by Xishan or the Western Hills . The Great Wall of China across the northern part of Beijing Municipality was built on the rugged topography to defend against nomadic incursions from the steppes . Mount Dongling , in the Western Hills and on the border with Hebei , is the municipality 's highest point , with an altitude of 2,303 metres ( 7,556 ft ) . </P> Remnants of the Great Wall of China in the mountains north of the city . <P> Major rivers flowing through the municipality , including the Chaobai , Yongding , Juma , are all tributaries in the Hai River system , and flow in a southeasterly direction . The Miyun Reservoir , on the upper reaches of the Chaobai River , is the largest reservoir within the municipality . Beijing is also the northern terminus of the Grand Canal to Hangzhou , which was built over 1,400 years ago as a transportation route , and the South -- North Water Transfer Project , constructed in the past decade to bring water from the Yangtze River basin . </P> <P> The urban area of Beijing , on the plains in the south - central of the municipality with elevation of 40 to 60 metres ( 130 -- 200 feet ) , occupies a relatively small but expanding portion of the municipality 's area . The city spreads out in concentric ring roads . The Second Ring Road traces the old city walls and the Sixth Ring Road connects satellite towns in the surrounding suburbs . Tian'anmen and Tian'anmen Square are at the center of Beijing , directly to the south of the Forbidden City , the former residence of the emperors of China . To the west of Tian'anmen is Zhongnanhai , the residence of China 's current leaders . Chang'an Avenue , which cuts between Tiananmen and the Square , forms the city 's main east - west axis . </P> <H3> Climate ( edit ) </H3> <P> Beijing has a monsoon - influenced humid continental climate ( Köppen climate classification Dwa ) , characterized by higher humidity in the summers due to the East Asian monsoon , and colder , windier , drier winters that reflect the influence of the vast Siberian anticyclone . Spring can bear witness to sandstorms blowing in from the Gobi Desert across the Mongolian steppe , accompanied by rapidly warming , but generally dry , conditions . Autumn , like Spring , is a season of transition and minimal precipitation . The monthly daily average temperature in January is − 3.7 ° C ( 25.3 ° F ) , while in July it is 26.2 ° C ( 79.2 ° F ) . Precipitation averages around 570 mm ( 22 in ) annually , with close to three - fourths of that total falling from June to August .

Between 2000 and 2009 Beijing 's urban extent quadrupled , which not only strongly increased the extent of anthropogenic emissions , but also changed the meteorological situation fundamentally , even if emissions of human society are not included . For example , surface albedo , wind speed and humidity near the surface were decreased , whereas ground and near - surface air temperatures , vertical air dilution and ozone levels were increased . Because of the combined factors of urbanization and pollution caused by burning of fossil fuel , Beijing is often affected by serious environmental problems , which lead to health issues of many inhabitants . In 2013 heavy smog struck Beijing and most parts of northern China , in total 600 million people . After this `` pollution shock '' air pollution became an important economic and social concern in China . After that the government of Beijing announced measures to reduce air pollution , for example by lowering the share of coal from 24 % in 2012 to 10 % in 2017 , while the national government ordered heavily polluting vehicles to be removed from 2015 to 2017 and increased its efforts to transition the energy system to clean sources . </P> Air quality ( edit ) <P> Joint research between American and Chinese researchers in 2006 concluded that much of the city 's pollution comes from surrounding cities and provinces . On average 35 -- 60 % of the ozone can be traced to sources outside the city . Shandong Province and Tianjin Municipality have a `` significant influence on Beijing 's air quality '' , partly due to the prevailing south / southeasterly flow during the summer and the mountains to the north and northwest . </P> Heavy air pollution has resulted in widespread smog . These photographs , taken in August 2005 , show the variations in Beijing 's air quality . <P> In preparation for the 2008 Summer Olympics and to fulfill promises to clean up the city 's air , nearly 17 billion USD was spent . Beijing implemented a number of air improvement schemes for the duration of the Games , including halting work at all construction sites , closing many factories in Beijing permanently , temporarily shutting industry in neighboring regions , closing some gas stations , and cutting motor traffic by half by limiting drivers to odd or even days ( based on their license plate numbers ) , reducing bus and subway fares , opening new subway lines , and banning high - emission vehicles . The city further assembled 3,800 natural gas - powered buses , one of the largest fleets in the world . Beijing became the first city in China to require the Chinese equivalent to the Euro 4 emission standard . </P> <P> Coal burning accounts for about 40 % of the PM 2.5 in Beijing and is also the chief source of nitrogen and sulphur dioxide . Since 2012 , the city has been converting coal - fired power stations to burn natural gas and aims to cap annual coal consumption at 20 million tons . In 2011 , the city burned 26.3 million tons of coal , 73 % of which for heating and power generation and the remainder for industry . Much of the city 's air pollutants are emitted by neighboring regions . Coal consumption in neighboring Tianjin is expected to increase from 48 to 63 million tons from 2011 to 2015 . Hebei Province burned over 300 million tons of coal in 2011 , more than all of Germany , of which only 30 % were used for power generation and a considerable portion for steel and cement making . Power plants in the coal - mining regions of Shanxi , Inner Mongolia and Shaanxi , where coal consumption has tripled since 2000 , and Shandong also contribute to air pollution in Beijing . Shandong , Shanxi , Hebei and Inner Mongolia , respectively rank from first to fourth , among Chinese provinces by coal consumption . There were four major coal - fired power plants in the city to provide electricity as well as heating during the winter . The first one ( Gaojing Thermal Power Plant ) was shut down in 2014 . Another two were shut in March 2015 . The last one ( Huaneng Thermal Power Plant ) would be shut in 2016 . Between 2013 and 2017 , the city planned to reduce 13 million tons of coal consumption and cap coal consumption to 15 million tons in 2015 . </P> <P> The government sometimes uses cloud - seeding measures to increase the likelihood of rain showers in the region to clear the air prior to large events , such as prior to the 60th anniversary parade in 2009 as well as to combat drought conditions in the area . More recently , however , the government has increased its usage of such measures as closing factories temporarily and implementing greater restrictions for cars on the road , as in the case of `` APEC blue '' and `` parade blue , '' short periods during and immediately preceding the APEC China 2014 and the 2015 China Victory Day Parade , respectively . During and prior to these events , Beijing 's air quality improved dramatically , only to fall back to unhealthy levels shortly after . </P> <P> Beijing air quality is often poor , especially in winter . In mid-January 2013 , Beijing 's air quality was measured on top of the city 's US embassy at a PM2. 5 density of 755 micrograms per cubic meter , which went off the US Environmental Protection Agency 's air quality index . It was widely reported , originally through a Twitter account , that the category was `` crazy bad '' . This was later changed to `` beyond index '' . </P> <P> On 8 and 9 December 2015 Beijing had its first smog alert which shut down a majority of the industry and other commercial businesses in the city . Later in the month another smog `` red alert '' was issued . </P> <P> According to Beijing 's environmental protection bureau 's announcement in November 2016 , starting from 2017 highly polluting old cars wil be banned from being driven whenever Smog `` red alerts '' are issued in the city or neighboring regions . </P> Readings ( edit ) <P> Due to Beijing 's high - level of air pollution , there are various readings by different sources on the subject . Daily pollution readings at 27 monitoring stations around the city are reported on the website of the Beijing Environmental Protection Bureau ( BJEPB ) . The American Embassy of Beijing also reports hourly fine particulate ( PM2. 5 ) and ozone levels on Twitter . Since the BJEPB and US Embassy measure different pollutants according to different criteria , the pollution levels and the impact to human health reported by the BJEPB are often lower than that reported by the US Embassy . </P> Air pollution in Beijing in 2016 , measured by Air Quality Index Severely Polluted Heavily Polluted Moderately Polluted Lightly Polluted Good Excellent Dust storms ( edit ) <P> Dust from the erosion of deserts in northern and northwestern China results in seasonal dust storms that plague the city ; the Beijing Weather Modification Office sometimes artificially induces rainfall to fight such storms and mitigate their effects . In the first four months of 2006 alone , there were no fewer than eight such storms . In April 2002 , one dust storm alone dumped nearly 50,000 tons of dust onto the city before moving on to Japan and Korea . </P> <H2> Politics and government ( edit ) </H2> Main article : Politics of Beijing <P> Municipal government is regulated by the local Communist Party of China ( CPC ) , led by the Beijing CPC Secretary ( Chinese : 北京 市委 书记 ) . The local CPC issues administrative orders , collects taxes , manages the economy , and directs a standing committee of the Municipal People 's Congress in making policy decisions and overseeing the local government . </P> <P> Government officials include the mayor ( Chinese : 市 长 ) and vice-mayor . Numerous bureaus focus on law , public security , and other affairs . Additionally , as the capital of China , Beijing houses all of the important national governmental and political institutions , including the National People 's Congress . </P> <H3> Administrative divisions ( edit ) </H3> Main articles : List of administrative divisions of Beijing and List of township - level divisions of Beijing <P> Beijing Municipality currently comprises 16 administrative county - level subdivisions including 16 urban , suburban , and rural districts . On 1 July 2010 , Chongwen and Xuanwu were merged into Dongcheng and Xicheng , respectively . On 13 November 2015 Miyun and Yanqing were upgraded to districts . </P> <Table> <Tr> <Th_colspan=\"14\"> Administrative divisions of Beijing </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td_colspan=\"6\"> Dongcheng Xicheng

This speech is the basis for putonghua , the standard spoken language used in mainland China and Taiwan , and one of the four official languages of Singapore . Rural areas of Beijing Municipality have their own dialects akin to those of Hebei province , which surrounds Beijing Municipality . </P> <P> Beijing or Peking opera ( 京剧 , Jīngjù ) is a traditional form of Chinese theater well known throughout the nation . Commonly lauded as one of the highest achievements of Chinese culture , Beijing opera is performed through a combination of song , spoken dialogue , and codified action sequences involving gestures , movement , fighting and acrobatics .

First , there is the traditional architecture of imperial China , perhaps best exemplified by the massive Tian'anmen ( Gate of Heavenly Peace ) , which remains the People 's Republic of China 's trademark edifice , the Forbidden City , the Imperial Ancestral Temple and the Temple of Heaven . Next , there is what is sometimes referred to as the `` Sino - Sov '' style , with structures tending to be boxy and sometimes poorly constructed , which were built between the 1950s and the 1970s . Finally , there are much more modern architectural forms , most noticeably in the area of the Beijing CBD in east Beijing such as the new CCTV Headquarters , in addition to buildings in other locations around the city such as the Beijing National Stadium and National Center for the Performing Arts . </P> <P> Since 2007 , buildings in Beijing have received the CTBUH Skyscraper Award for best overall tall building twice , for the Linked Hybrid building in 2009 and the CCTV Headquarters in 2013 .

Beijing 's current completed tallest building is the 330 - meter China World Trade Center Tower III , but will be surpassed by the 528 - meter China Zun in 2018 when it is completed . Both buildings are in the Beijing CBD . </P> <P> Beijing is famous for its siheyuans , a type of residence where a common courtyard is shared by the surrounding buildings . Among the more grand examples are the Prince Gong Mansion and Residence of Soong Ching - ling . These courtyards are usually connected by alleys called hutongs . The hutongs are generally straight and run east to west so that doorways face north and south for good Feng Shui . They vary in width ; some are so narrow only a few pedestrians can pass through at a time . Once ubiquitous in Beijing , siheyuans and hutongs are rapidly disappearing , as entire city blocks of hutongs are replaced by high - rise buildings . Residents of the hutongs are entitled to live in the new buildings in apartments of at least the same size as their former residences . Many complain , however , that the traditional sense of community and street life of the hutongs can not be replaced , and these properties are often government owned . </P> <H3> Religion ( edit ) </H3> <P> Religion in Beijing ( 2010s ) </P> Chinese religion or not religious and atheists ( 86.26 % ) Buddhism ( 11.2 % ) Islam ( 1.76 % ) Christianity ( 0.78 % ) A Temple of the Goddess in Gubeikou .

An articulated Beijing bus . Bicyclists during rush hour at the Chang'an Avenue . Typical Beijing traffic signage found at intersections . <P> Beijing is an important transport hub in North China with five ring roads , nine expressways , eleven National Highways , nine conventional railways , and two high - speed railways converging on the city . </P> <H3> Rail and high - speed rail ( edit ) </H3> <P> Beijing serves as a large rail hub in China 's railway network . Ten conventional rail lines radiate from the city to : Shanghai ( Jinghu Line ) , Guangzhou ( Jingguang Line ) , Kowloon ( Jingjiu Line ) , Harbin ( Jingha Line ) , Baotou ( Jingbao Line ) , Qinhuangdao ( Jingqin Line ) , Chengde ( Jingcheng Line ) , Tongliao , Inner Mongolia ( Jingtong Line ) , Yuanping , Shanxi ( Jingyuan Line ) and Shacheng , Hebei ( Fengsha Line ) . In addition , the Datong -- Qinhuangdao Railway passes through the municipality to the north of the city . </P> <P> Beijing also has three high - speed rail lines : the Beijing - Tianjin Intercity Railway , which opened in 2008 ; the Beijing - Shanghai High - Speed Railway , which opened in 2011 ; and the Beijing -- Guangzhou High - Speed Railway , which opened in 2012 . </P> <P> The city 's main railway stations are the Beijing Railway Station , which opened in 1959 ; the Beijing West Railway Station , which opened in 1996 ; and the Beijing South Railway Station , which was rebuilt into the city 's high - speed railway station in 2008 . As of 1 July 2010 , Beijing Railway Station had 173 trains arriving daily , Beijing West had 232 trains and Beijing South had 163 . The Beijing North Railway Station , first built in 1909 and expanded in 2009 , had 22 trains . </P> <P> Smaller stations in the city including Beijing East Railway Station and Qinghuayuan Railway Station handle mainly commuter passenger traffic . The Fengtai Railway Station has been closed for renovation . In outlying suburbs and counties of Beijing , there are over 40 railway stations . </P> <P> From Beijing , direct passenger train service is available to most large cities in China . International train service is available to Mongolia , Russia , Vietnam and North Korea . Passenger trains in China are numbered according to their direction in relation to Beijing . </P> <H3> Roads and expressways ( edit ) </H3> Further information : Expressways of Beijing and China National Highways of Beijing <P> Beijing is connected by road links to all parts of China as part of the National Trunk Road Network . Nine expressways of China serve Beijing , as do eleven China National Highways . Beijing 's urban transport is dependent upon the five `` ring roads '' that concentrically surround the city , with the Forbidden City area marked as the geographical centre for the ring roads . The ring roads appear more rectangular than ring - shaped . There is no official `` 1st Ring Road '' . The 2nd Ring Road is located in the inner city . Ring roads tend to resemble expressways progressively as they extend outwards , with the 5th and 6th Ring Roads being full - standard national expressways , linked to other roads only by interchanges . Expressways to other regions of China are generally accessible from the 3rd Ring Road outward . A final outer orbital , the Capital Ring Expressway ( G95 ) , is being built and will extend into neighboring Tianjin and Hebei . </P> <P> Within the urban core , city streets generally follow the checkerboard pattern of the ancient capital . Many of Beijing 's boulevards and streets with `` inner '' and `` outer '' are still named in relation to gates in the city wall , though most gates no longer stand . Traffic jams are a major concern . Even outside of rush hour , several roads still remain clogged with traffic . </P> <P> Beijing 's urban design layout further exacerbates transportation problems . The authorities have introduced several bus lanes , which only public buses can use during rush hour . In the beginning of 2010 , Beijing had 4 million registered automobiles . By the end of 2010 , the government forecast 5 million . In 2010 , new car registrations in Beijing averaged 15,500 per week . </P> <P> Towards the end of 2010 , the city government announced a series of drastic measures to tackle traffic jams , including limiting the number of new license plates issued to passenger cars to 20,000 a month and barring cars with non-Beijing plates from entering areas within the Fifth Ring Road during rush hour . More restrictive measures are also reserved during major events or heavily polluted weather . </P> <H3> Air ( edit ) </H3> <P> Beijing 's primary airport is the Beijing Capital International Airport ( IATA : PEK ) about 20 kilometres ( 12 mi ) northeast of the city centre . The airport is the second busiest airport in the world after Hartsfield - Jackson Atlanta International Airport . After renovations for the 2008 Olympics , the airport now boasts three terminals , with Terminal 3 being one of the largest in the world . Most domestic and nearly all international flights arrive at and depart from Capital Airport . It is the main hub for Air China and a hub for China Southern and Hainan Airlines . The airport links Beijing with almost every other Chinese city with regular air passenger service . </P> <P> The Airport Expressway links the airport to central Beijing ; it is a roughly 40 - minute drive from the city centre during good traffic conditions . Prior to the 2008 Olympics , the 2nd Airport Expressway was built to the airport , as well as a light rail system , which now connects to the Beijing Subway . </P> <P> Other airports in the city include Liangxiang , Nanyuan , Xijiao , Shahe and Badaling . These airports are primarily for military use and are less well known to the public . Nanyuan serves as the hub for only one passenger airline . A second international airport , to be called Beijing Daxing International Airport , is currently being built in Daxing District , and is expected to be open by 2017 . </P> <P> As of 1 January 2013 , tourists from 45 countries are permitted a 72 - hour visa - free stay in Beijing . The 45 countries include Singapore , Japan , the United States , Canada , all EU and EEA countries ( except Norway and Liechtenstein ) , Switzerland , Brazil , Argentina and Australia . The programme benefits transit and business travellers with the 72 hours calculated starting from the moment visitors receive their transit stay permits rather than the time of their plane 's arrival . Foreign visitors are not permitted to leave Beijing for other Chinese cities during the 72 hours . </P> <H3> Public transit ( edit ) </H3> <P> The Beijing Subway , which began operating in 1969 , now has 19 lines , 345 stations , and 574 km ( 357 mi ) of lines . It is the second longest subway system in the world and first in annual ridership with 3.66 billion rides delivered in 2016 . In 2013 , with a flat fare of ¥ 2.00 ( 0.31 USD ) per ride with unlimited transfers on all lines except the Airport Express , the subway was also the most affordable rapid transit system in China . The subway is undergoing rapid expansion and is expected to reach 30 lines , 450 stations , 1,050 kilometres ( 650 mi ) in length by 2020 . When fully implemented , 95 % of residents inside the Fourth Ring Road will be able to walk to a station in 15 minutes . The Beijing Suburban Railway provides commuter rail service to outlying suburbs of the municipality . </P> <P> On December 28 , 2014 , the Beijing Subway switched to a distance - based fare system from a fixed fare for all lines except the Airport Express . Under the new system a trip under 6 km will cost ¥ 3.00 ( 0.49 USD ) , an additional ¥ 1.00 will be added for the next 6 kilometres ( 3.7 miles ) and the next 10 kilometres ( 6.2 miles ) until the distance for the trip reaches 32 kilometres ( 20 miles ) . For every 20 kilometres ( 12 miles ) after the original 32 kilometres ( 20 miles ) an additional ¥ 1.00 is added . For example , a 50 kilometres ( 31 miles ) trip would cost ¥ 8.00 . </P> <P> There are nearly 1,000 public bus and trolleybus lines in the city , including four bus rapid transit lines . Standard bus fares are as low as ¥ 1.00 when purchased with the Yikatong metrocard . </P> <H3> Taxi ( edit ) </H3> <P> Metered taxi in Beijing start at ¥ 13 for the first 3 kilometres ( 1.9 mi ) , ¥ 2.3 Renminbi per additional 1 kilometre ( 0.62 mi ) and ¥ 1 per ride fuel surcharge , not counting idling fees which are ¥ 2.3 ( ¥ 4.6 during rush hours of 7 -- 9 am and 5 -- 7 pm ) per 5 minutes of standing or running at speeds lower than 12 kilometres per hour ( 7.5 mph ) . Most taxis are Hyundai Elantras , Hyundai Sonatas , Peugeots , Citroëns and Volkswagen Jettas . After 15 kilometres ( 9.3 mi ) , the base fare increases by 50 % ( but is only applied to the portion over that distance ) . Different companies have special colours combinations painted on their vehicles . Usually registered taxis have yellowish brown as basic hue , with another color of Prussian blue , hunter green , white , umber , tyrian purple , rufous , or sea green . Between 11 pm and 5 am , there is also a 20 % fee increase . Rides over 15 km ( 9 mi ) and between 23 : 00 and 06 : 00 incur both charges , for a total increase of 80 % . Tolls during trip should be covered by customers and the costs of trips beyond Beijing city limits should be negotiated with the driver . The cost of unregistered taxis is also subject to negotiation with the driver . </P> <H3> Bicycles ( edit ) </H3> <P> Beijing has long been well known for the number of bicycles on its streets . Although the rise of motor traffic has created a great deal of congestion and bicycle use has declined , bicycles are still an important form of local transportation . Large numbers of cyclists can be seen on most roads in the city , and most of the main roads have dedicated bicycle lanes . Beijing is relatively flat , which makes cycling convenient . The rise of electric bicycles and electric scooters , which have similar speeds and use the same cycle lanes , may have brought about a revival in bicycle - speed two - wheeled transport . It is possible to cycle to most parts of the city . Because of the growing traffic congestion , the authorities have indicated more than once that they wish to encourage cycling , but it is not clear whether there is sufficient will to translate that into action on a significant scale . Recently , cycling has seen a resurgence in popularity thanks to the emergence of a large number of dockless app based bikeshares such as Mobike , Bluegogo and Ofo . </P> <H2> Defense and aerospace ( edit ) </H2> Chinese President Xi Jinping and a military honor guard welcomes South Korean president Park Geun - hye in June 2013 . <P> The command headquarters of China 's military forces are based in Beijing . The Central Military Commission , the political organ in charge of the military , is housed inside the Ministry of National Defense , located next to the Military Museum of the Chinese People 's Revolution in western Beijing . The Second Artillery Corps , which controls the country 's strategic missile and nuclear weapons , has its command in Qinghe , Haidian District . The headquarters of the Beijing Military Region , one of seven nationally , is based further west in Gaojing . The Beijing Military Region oversees the Beijing Garrisons as well as the 27th , 38th and 65th Armies , which are based in Hebei . </P> <P> Military institutions in Beijing also include academies and thinktanks such as the PLA National Defence University and Academy of Military Science , military hospitals such as the 301 , 307 and the Academy of Military Medical Sciences , and army - affiliated cultural entities such as the 1 August Film Studios and the PLA Song and Dance Troupe . </P> <P> The China National Space Administration , which oversees country 's space program , and several space - related state owned companies such as CASTC and CASIC are all based in Beijing . The Beijing Aerospace Command and Control Center , in Haidian District tracks the country 's manned and unmanned flight and other space exploration initiatives . </P> <H2> Nature and Wildlife ( edit ) </H2> <P> Beijing Municipality has 20 nature reserves that have a total area of 1,339.7 km ( 517.3 sq mi ) . The mountains to the west and north of the city are home to a number of protected wildlife species including leopard , leopard cat , wolf , red fox , wild boar , masked palm civet , raccoon dog , hog badger , Siberian weasel , Amur hedgehog , roe deer , and mandarin rat snake . The Beijing Aquatic Wildlife Rescue and Conservation Center protects the Chinese giant salamander , Amur stickleback and mandarin duck on the Huaijiu and Huaisha Rivers in Huairou District . The Beijing Milu Park south of the city is home to one of the largest herds of Père David 's deer , now extinct in the wild . The Beijing barbastelle , a species of vesper bat discovered in caves of Fangshan District in 2001 and identified as a distinct species in 2007 , is endemic to Beijing . The mountains of Fangshan are also habitat for the more common Beijing mouse - eared bat , large myotis , greater horseshoe bat and Rickett 's big - footed bat . </P> <P> Each year , Beijing hosts 200 - 300 species of migratory birds including the common crane , black - headed gull , swan , mallard , common cuckoo and the endangered yellow - breasted bunting . In May 2016 , Common cuckoos nesting in the wetlands of Cuihu ( Haidian ) , Hanshiqiao ( Shunyi ) , Yeyahu ( Yanqing ) were tagged and have been traced to far as India , Kenya and Mozambique . In the fall of 2016 , the Beijing Forest Police undertook a month - long campaign to crack down on illegal hunting and trapping of migratory birds for sale in local bird markets . Over 1,000 rescued birds of protected species including streptopelia , Eurasian siskin , crested myna , coal tit and great tit were handed to the Beijing Wildlife Protection and Rescue Center for repatriation to the wild . </P> <P> The city flowers are the Chinese rose and chrysanthemum . The city trees are the Chinese arborvitae , an evergreen in the cypress family and the Pagoda Tree , also called the Chinese scholar tree , a deciduous tree of the Fabaceae family . The oldest scholar tree in the city was planted in what is now Beihai Park during the Tang Dynasty , 1,300 years ago . </P> <H2> See also ( edit ) </H2> <Ul> <Li> Beijing portal </Li> <Li> China portal </Li> </Ul> <Ul> <Li> 2045 Peking -- the name of an asteroid </Li> <Li> Beijing city fortifications </Li> <Li> Historical capitals of China </Li> <Li> Large Cities Climate Leadership Group </Li> <Li> List of hospitals in Beijing </Li> <Li> List of mayors of Beijing </Li> <Li> List of twin towns and sister cities in China </Li> </Ul> <H2> References ( edit ) </H2> <Ol> <Li> ^ Jump up to : `` Township divisions '' . the Official Website of tGovernment .

It opened in 1981 and was rethemed in 2004 coinciding with its sponsorship by Imperial Leather . The ride was a bath time themed log flume with three drops . It was the longest log flume attraction in the world at the time of opening . The attraction closed in 2015 and was removed a year later for the area 's redevelopment into the SW8 rollercoaster . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Ride Experience </Li> <Li> 2 History </Li> <Li> 3 Media gallery </Li> <Li> 4 References </Li> <Li> 5 External links </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> Ride experience ( edit ) </H2> <P> The ride was about 6 minutes long and starts by loading in the circular station . Once the ' bath ' had dispatched from the station it went round a few turns and up to the first lift hill . The car then dropped down a small drop and turned around the woodland until it came to the second lift hill which was enclosed in a hut - style building & a drop which was in the dark . At the bottom there was a giant rubber duck that you go past . The ride then wound around the woodland again and then went 86ft up a lift hill and then dropped 85ft down a drop into some brakes . Finally the ' bath ' went through two showers and back into the station . </P> <H2> History ( edit ) </H2> <P> In 1980 , Alton Towers opened the ride Corkscrew along with a few other amusement attractions . Alton Towers gained popularity so for the 1981 season they decided to open a log flume . Construction started in late 1980 to open the ride for the 1981 season . the park 's first major scale engineering project including purpose built reservoir sunk into a former field . The 5.5 acre site was bordered on 2 sides by the Park Railway . initially access to the new ride was via a railway bridge over the tracks , by 1982 the Railway had been shortened to allow easier access for the popular new ride . </P> <P> In 1981 the ' White Water Flume ' opened to the public as the world 's longest log flume with it 's 2600ft waterway themed around the Canadian Falls , by 1983 the ride had acquired it 's traditional and more popular name of ' The Log Flume ' & for the next 23 years operated as such . Between 1984 - 95 it also featured props from ' Dinosaur Land ' which had been closed the previous season to make way for The Black Hole , including a prehistoric family inside the tunnel section of the flume . In 2004 the ride was re-themed to ' The Flume ' with a bath theme , as sponsored by a soap manufacturer ; new ' bath ' boats replacing the logs , new lining , maintenance , a refurbished station , a yellow duck , shower and other bath - time theming . In 2008 , the area in which the ride operated was re-themed to Mutiny Bay , however the ride retained its bath time theme . </P> <P> Weeks before the beginning of the 2016 season , Alton Towers announced that the ride was to be closed permanently . On March 16 , 2016 , the park posted a photo through their Towers Loving Care Twitter page of a sign on the perimeter of the former area of the attraction that reads `` SW8 .

      "result: Finances of the British Royal family - wikipedia <H1> Finances of the British Royal family </H1> Jump to : navigation , search <P> The British royal family is financed by the hereditary revenues of the Crown . The British Parliament uses a percentage of the Crown Estate , a part of the Crown 's hereditary revenues belonging to the sovereign that is placed at the disposal of the House of Commons , to meet the costs of the sovereign 's official expenditures . This includes the costs of the upkeep of the various royal residences , staffing , travel and state visits , public engagements , and official entertainment . Other sources of income include revenues from the Duchies of Lancaster and Cornwall , a parliamentary annuity , and income from private investments . The Keeper of the Privy Purse is Head of the Privy Purse and Treasurer 's Office and has overall responsibility for the management of the sovereign 's financial affairs . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Income <Ul> <Li> 1.1 Civil List </Li> <Li> 1.2 Sovereign Grant </Li> <Li> 1.3 Duchy of Lancaster </Li> <Li> 1.4 Duchy of Cornwall </Li> <Li> 1.5 Parliamentary annuities </Li> <Li> 1.6 Taxation </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 2 Assets <Ul> <Li> 2.1 Private wealth of the Queen </Li> <Li> 2.2 Crown Estate </Li> <Li> 2.3 Assets held in trust </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 3 References </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> Income ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Civil List ( edit ) </H3> Main article : Civil list <P> Until 1760 the monarch met all official expenses from hereditary revenues , which included the profits of the Crown Estate ( the royal property portfolio ) . King George III agreed to surrender the hereditary revenues of the Crown in return for the Civil List , and this arrangement persisted from 1760 until 2012 . The Civil List was paid from public funds and was intended to support the exercise of the monarch 's duties as head of state of the United Kingdom . In modern times , the Government 's profits from the Crown Estate always significantly exceeded the Civil List . Under the Civil List arrangements the royal family faced criticism for the lack of transparency surrounding Royal finances . The National Audit Office was not entitled to audit the Royal Household . </P> <P> The Queen received an annual £ 7.9 million a year from the Civil List between 2001 and 2012 . The total income of the Royal Household from the Treasury was always significantly larger than the Civil List because it included additional income such as Grants - in - Aid from the Treasury and revenues from the Duchies of Cornwall and Lancaster . The total Royal Household income for the financial years 2011 - 12 and 2012 - 13 was £ 30 million per annum , followed by a 14 % cut in the following year . However , the Treasury provided an additional £ 1 million to pay for Diamond Jubilee celebrations in 2012 . </P> <P> Royal expenditure differs from income due to the use of a Reserve Fund , which can be added to or drawn from . The official reported annual expenditure of the Head of State was £ 41.5 million for the 2008 - 09 financial year . This figure did not include the cost of security provided by the police and the Army and some other expenses . </P> <H3> Sovereign Grant ( edit ) </H3> Main article : Sovereign Grant Act 2011 <P> Under the Sovereign Grant Act 2011 , the system of funding the Royal Household by a mixture of Civil List payments and Grants - in - Aid was replaced . From 1 April 2012 a single annual Sovereign Grant has been paid by the Treasury . The level of funding for the Royal Household is now linked to the Government 's revenue from The Crown Estate . </P> <P> The Sovereign Grant Annual Report states that the Sovereign Grant was £ 31 million for 2012 - 13 , £ 36.1 million for 2013 - 14 and £ 37.9 million for 2014 - 15 . The amount of the Sovereign Grant is 15 % of the income account net surplus of the Crown Estate for the financial year that began two years previously . The arrangements will be reviewed by 2016 ( subsection 7 ( 5 ) of the Act ) . Step 4 of subsection 6 ( 1 ) , and subsection 6 ( 4 ) , of the Act provide a mechanism to prevent the amount of the Sovereign Grant increasing beyond what is necessary because of the growth in Crown Estate revenue . Under the Sovereign Grant the National Audit Office is able to audit the Royal Household . </P> <P> On November 18 , 2016 a plan was announced to increase the Sovereign Grant from 15 % to 25 % to renovate and repair Buckingham Palace . The percentage is set to revert to 15 % when the project is finished in 2027 . </P> <H3> Duchy of Lancaster ( edit ) </H3> Main article : Duchy of Lancaster <P> The Duchy of Lancaster is the private estate of the British Sovereign ( now Queen Elizabeth II ) consisting of land holdings and other assets . As it is held in perpetual trust for future generations of Sovereigns , the Sovereign is not entitled to the estate 's capital . The revenue profits of the Duchy are presented to the Sovereign each year and form part of the Privy Purse , providing income for both the official and private expenses of the monarch . In the financial year ending 31 March 2015 , the Duchy was valued at £ 472 million , providing £ 16 million in income . </P> <P> In 2017 , the Paradise Papers revealed that the Duchy held investments in two offshore financial centres , the Cayman Islands and Bermuda . Both are British Overseas Territories of which Queen Elizabeth II is monarch , and nominally appoints governors . Britain handles foreign policy for both islands to a large extent , but Bermuda has been self - governing since 1620 . The Duchy 's investments included First Quench Retailing off - licences and rent - to - own retailer BrightHouse . Labour Party Leader Jeremy Corbyn posited whether the Queen should apologize , saying anyone with money offshore for tax avoidance should `` not just apologise for it , ( but ) recognise what it does to our society '' . A spokesman for the Duchy said that all of their investments are audited and legitimate and that the Queen voluntarily pays taxes on income she receives from Duchy investments . </P> <H3> Duchy of Cornwall ( edit ) </H3> Main article : Duchy of Cornwall <P> The Duchy of Cornwall is a Crown entity holding land and other assets to produce an income for the monarch 's eldest child . The Duke of Cornwall ( Charles , Prince of Wales ) receives revenue towards charitable work and official activities , supported by The Queen 's Grant - in - aid funding to provide assistance with official travel and property . These financial arrangements also cover the official expenditure of some members of his immediate family . The Duchess of Cornwall , The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry all have their official expenses paid from Duchy income , assisted by grants - in aid from The Queen . For the fiscal year 2011 - 12 the Duchy was valued at £ 728 million with an annual profit of £ 18.3 million paid to the Prince . </P> <H3> Parliamentary annuities ( edit ) </H3> <P> The Duke of Edinburgh receives a parliamentary annuity of £ 359,000 per year from the Treasury . In the past some other members of the British royal family also received funding in the form of parliamentary annuities . The Civil List Act 1952 provided for an allowance to Princess Margaret as well as allowances to the queen 's younger children among others . The Civil List Act 1972 added further members of the royal family to the annuity list . By 2002 there were eight recipients of parliamentary annuities ( all children or cousins of the Queen ) receiving a combined total of £ 1.5 million annually . Between 1993 and 2012 the Queen voluntarily refunded the cost of these annuities to the Treasury . The Sovereign Grant Act 2011 abolished all of these other than that received by the Duke of Edinburgh . Subsequently the living costs of the members of the royal family who carry out official duties , including the Princess Royal , the Duke of York , and the Earl and Countess of Wessex , have mainly been met through the Queen 's income from the Duchy of Lancaster . </P> <H3> Taxation ( edit ) </H3> <P> The Crown has a legal tax - exempt status because certain acts of parliament do not apply to it . Crown bodies such as The Duchy of Lancaster are not subject to legislation concerning income tax , capital gains tax or inheritance tax . Furthermore , the Sovereign has no legal liability to pay such taxes . The Duchy of Cornwall has a Crown exemption and the Prince of Wales is not legally liable to pay income tax on Duchy revenues . </P> <P> A `` Memorandum of Understanding on Royal Taxation '' was published on 5 February 1993 and amended in 1996 , 2009 and 2013 . It is intended that the arrangements in the memorandum will be followed by the next monarch . The memorandum describes the arrangements by which The Queen and The Prince of Wales make voluntary payments to the HM Revenue and Customs in lieu of tax to compensate for their tax exemption . The details of the payments are private . The Queen voluntarily pays a sum equivalent to income tax on her private income and income from the Privy Purse ( which includes the Duchy of Lancaster ) that is not used for official purposes . The Sovereign Grant is exempted . A sum equivalent to capital gains tax is voluntarily paid on any gains from the disposal of private assets made after 5 April 1993 . Many of the Sovereign 's assets were acquired earlier than this date but payment is only made on the gains made afterwards . Arrangements also exist for a sum in lieu of inheritance tax to be voluntarily paid on some of the Queen 's private assets . Property passing from monarch to monarch is exempted , as is property passing from the consort of a former monarch to the current monarch . </P> <P> The Prince of Wales voluntarily pays a sum equivalent to income tax on that part of his income from the Duchy of Cornwall that is in excess of what is needed to meet official expenditure . From 1969 he made voluntary tax payments of 50 % of the profits , but this reduced to 25 % in 1981 when he married Lady Diana Spencer . These arrangements were replaced by the memorandum in 1993 . The income of the Prince of Wales from sources other than the Duchy of Cornwall is subject to tax in the normal way . </P> <H2> Assets ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Private wealth of the Queen ( edit ) </H3> <P> The Queen has a private income from her personal investment portfolio , though her personal wealth and income are not known . Jock Colville , a former private secretary to the Queen ( when she was Princess Elizabeth ) and a director of her bank , Coutts , estimated her wealth at £ 2 million in 1971 ( the equivalent of about £ 26 million today ) . An official statement from Buckingham Palace in 1993 called estimates of £ 100 million `` grossly overstated '' . In 2002 , she inherited her mother 's estate , thought to have been worth £ 70 million ( the equivalent of about £ 105 million today ) . </P> <P> Forbes magazine estimated the Queen 's net worth at around $500 million ( about £ 325 million ) in 2011 , while an analysis by the Bloomberg Billionaires Index put it at $425 million ( about £ 275 million ) in 2015 . In 2012 the Sunday Times estimated the Queen 's wealth as being £ 310 million ( $504 million ) , and that year the Queen received a Guinness World Record as Wealthiest Queen . The Sunday Times Rich List 2015 estimated her wealth at £ 340 million , making her the 302nd richest person in the United Kingdom ; that was the first year she was not among the Sunday Times Rich List 's top 300 most wealthy since the list began in 1989 . She was number one on the list when it began in 1989 . </P> <P> Sandringham House and Balmoral Castle are privately owned by the Queen . </P> <H3> Crown Estate ( edit ) </H3> Main article : Crown Estate <P> The Crown Estate is one of the largest property owners in the United Kingdom , producing £ 211 million for the Treasury in the financial year 2007 -- 8 . and with holdings of £ 7.3 billion in 2011 . The Crown Estate is not the private property of the Monarch . It can not be sold or owned by the Sovereign in a private capacity , nor do any revenues , or debts , from the estate accrue to her . Instead the Crown Estate is owned by the Crown , a corporation representing the legal embodiment of the State . It is held in trust and governed by Act of Parliament , to which it makes an annual report . Revenue from the Crown Estate is thought to be due to double in real terms between 2010 and 2020 with additional lease revenues deriving from the development of offshore wind farms within Britain 's Renewable Energy Zone , the rights of which were granted to the Crown Estate by the Energy Act 2004 . </P> <H3> Assets held in trust ( edit ) </H3> <P> A number of State possessions are held in trust by the Sovereign . </P> <Ul> <Li> The Royal Collection is the art collection of the British royal family . It is one of the largest and most important art collections in the world , containing over 7,000 paintings , 40,000 watercolours and drawings , about 150,000 old master prints , historical photographs , tapestries , furniture , ceramics , books , gold and silver plate , arms and armour , jewellery and other works of art . The collection includes the Crown Jewels in the Tower of London ( including the crown , orb and sceptre ) . It is physically dispersed between thirteen Royal residences and former residences across Britain . Although the collection belongs to the sovereign , it is not the personal property of Elizabeth II as a private individual . Instead the collection is held in trust by the Queen for her successors and the nation . The Treasury refers to these assets as `` vested in the sovereign and can not be alienated '' . Income is generated by the collection from public admissions and other sources . This income is received by the Royal Collection Trust , the collection 's management charity , and not by the Queen . </Li> <Li> The occupied royal palaces in the United Kingdom such as Buckingham Palace and Windsor Castle are held in trust by the sovereign . The Royal Household is expected to use the Sovereign Grant to maintain the palaces . In May 2009 the Queen requested an extra £ 4 million annually from the government to carry out a backlog of repairs to Buckingham Palace . In 2010 , the Royal Household requested an additional grant from the Department for Culture , Media and Sport but were refused on the basis that the scheme was `` aimed at schools , hospitals , councils and housing associations for heating programmes which benefit low - income families '' . Over a third of the Royal estate was in disrepair by 2012 - 13 according to a report by the Public Accounts Committee . The cost of restoration was estimated to be £ 50 million , but the Reserve Fund was at a historic low of £ 1m . The Monarch is also responsible for using the Sovereign Grant to pay the wages of 431 of the approximately 1200 Royal Household staff , amounting to £ 18.2 million in 2014 - 15 . In 2013 , the Guardian newspaper reported that Buckingham Palace was using zero - hour contract for its summer staff and in 2015 it was reported that at least four senior officials had been made redundant to reduce costs . </Li> </Ul> <H2> References ( edit ) </H2> <Ol> <Li> ^ Jump up to : `` The Sovereign 's gracious message to the House of Commons re : The Sovereign Grant Bill '' ( PDF ) .

The players must deal with the pressures of adolescence and their football - obsessed community while having their hard coach on their back constantly . In the small ( fictional ) town of West Canaan , Texas , football is a way of life , and losing is not an option . </P> <P> The film drew a domestic box office gross of $52 million against its estimated $16 million budget despite mixed critical reviews . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Plot </Li> <Li> 2 Cast </Li> <Li> 3 Reception </Li> <Li> 4 Trademark Controversy </Li> <Li> 5 Soundtrack </Li> <Li> 6 Awards </Li> <Li> 7 TV series </Li> <Li> 8 References </Li> <Li> 9 External links </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> Plot ( edit ) </H2> <P> Jonathan `` Mox '' Moxon ( James Van Der Beek ) is an intelligent and academically gifted backup quarterback for the West Canaan High School football team . Despite his relative popularity at school , easy friendships with other players and smart and sassy girlfriend Jules Harbor ( Amy Smart ) , he is dissatisfied with his life . He wants to leave Texas to go to school at Brown University . He is constantly at odds with his football - obsessed father , Sam ( Thomas F. Duffy ) , and dreads playing it under legendary coach Bud Kilmer ( Jon Voight ) , a verbally abusive , controlling authoritarian who believes in winning at all costs . He has a strong track record as coach : in 30 years of coaching at West Canaan , he has won two state titles and 22 district championships , and only cares about winning his 23rd . His philosophy finally takes its toll on all - state starting quarterback , Lance Harbor ( Paul Walker ) , Mox 's best friend and Jules 's brother , who has earned a football scholarship to play for Florida State . He is manipulated by Kilmer into taking anesthetic shots on an injured knee that finally succumbs to failure and results in even greater injury after getting sacked during a game . He is rushed to the hospital , where doctors are appalled at the massive amount of scar tissue found under his knee and determine that the effects of the injury are permanent and will prevent him from being able to play football for a year and a half , costing him his FSU scholarship . </P> <P> Mox , who has accompanied Lance to the hospital , is shocked when Kilmer feigns ignorance to Lance 's doctors about his knee problems , when in fact Kilmer ordered the trainer to inject the shots . In need of a new quarterback , he reluctantly names Mox to replace Lance as captain and starting quarterback . The move brings unexpected dividends for him , one of them being Darcy Sears ( Ali Larter ) , Lance 's cheerleader girlfriend , who is interested in marrying a football player in order to escape small - town life . She even goes so far as to attempt to seduce Mox , sporting a `` bikini '' made of whipped cream over her otherwise naked body , but he rebuffs her as politely as he can and helps to cheer her up by telling her that she can get out of West Canaan on her own without anyone 's help . </P> <P> Disgusted with Kilmer and not feeling a strong need to win , Mox starts calling his own plays on the field without Kilmer 's approval and takes his group of friends and teammates , including Lance , out to a strip club on the night before a game , which they subsequently lose due to poor play from still being hungover . He also chides his father , Sam , screaming at him , `` I do n't want your life ! '' Sam had been a football player at West Canaan under Kilmer and although Kilmer dismissed him as having no talent nor courage , he still respected and obeyed him . When Kilmer becomes aware that Mox has earned a full academic scholarship to Brown , he threatens him that if he continues to disobey and disrespect him , he will alter his transcripts in order to reverse the decision on his scholarship . </P> <P> Kilmer 's lack of concern for his players continues , resulting in an emotional breakdown of offensive guard , Billy Bob ( Ron Lester ) , who had suffered a head injury weeks earlier ( Billy Bob had missed a block when he passed out on the field as a result of this injury after Kilmer pressured him out onto the field , which allowed the hit on Lance that crippled his knee , in which Kilmer blames him for ) . When starting tailback Wendell Brown ( Eliel Swinton ) , another friend of Mox 's , is injured on the field during the final game of the season , Kilmer pressures him during halftime into taking a shot of cortisone , as he had done with Lance , to deaden the pain from his injury and allow him to continue at the risk of permanent injury . Desperate to be recruited by a good college , Wendell agrees . Mox intervenes and threatens Kilmer that he 'll quit the team if the needle enters Wendell 's knee . Undaunted , Kilmer reminds him about altering his transcripts and orders Charlie Tweeder ( Scott Caan ) , starting wide receiver and friend of Mox , Lance and Wendell , to replace Mox , but he also quits . Billy Bob also steps in to defend his teammates . Mox tells Kilmer that the only way they will return to the field for the second half is without him . Realizing that he will be forced to forfeit the game , he loses control and physically assaults Mox . The other players intercede and then refuse to take to the field . Knowing his loss of control has cost him his credibility , Kilmer tries in vain to rally support and spark the team 's spirit into trusting him , but none of the players follow him out of the locker room . He continues down the hall , and upon seeing that no one following him , turns the other direction and into his office . After an inspiring speech from Mox to rally the team , they take the field under the leadership of Lance , who takes over coaching duties for the second half , and manage to win the game . </P> <P> In a voice - over epilogue , Mox recounts several characters ' aftermaths , including the fact that Kilmer left town and never coached again despite his statue still standing ( only because it was too heavy to move ) . Lance became a successful coach ( presumably Head Coach for the Coyotes after Kilmer 's departure ) , Wendell earned a football scholarship to Grambling , and Mox took his scholarship and graduated from Brown University , but he never played football again . </P> <H2> Cast ( edit ) </H2> <Ul> <Li> James Van Der Beek as Jonathon `` Mox '' Moxon , the main protagonist .

Though it had a 39.6 % decline in earnings , it was still enough to keep it at the top spot for another week . </P> <P> Critical reception was mixed ; the film has a 40 % ( `` Rotten '' ) approval rating from 52 reviews on Rotten Tomatoes , with the consensus `` This is a predictable football movie that lacks intensity . '' Roger Ebert noted in his Chicago Sun - Times review that `` Scenes work , but they do n't pile up and build momentum . '' ReelViews online film critic James Berardinelli 's summary was that although it `` takes a worthwhile detour or two , it ultimately finds its way back to the well - worn track of its genre . '' </P> <P> The film was later parodied in the 2001 movie , Not Another Teen Movie , in which Ron Lester reprises his role of Billy Bob by playing a nearly identical character named Reggie Ray . Ali Larter 's whipped cream bikini was also parodied . It was also quoted in the 2004 teen comedy film Mean Girls as being Regina George 's favorite movie . </P> <H2> Trademark controversy ( edit ) </H2> <P> In early 1999 , Paramount Pictures was sued by the University of Toronto for trademark infringement , as Varsity Blues is the registered trademark and name of the University 's intercollegiate athletic teams . The University alleged that the movie conveyed a poor depiction and negative stereotypes of collegiate sports , and asserted that the University did not wish to be associated with such a production . Bruce Kidd , Dean of the Faculty of Physical and Health Education , further noted that the movie demonstrated an abusive approach to sports in an educational setting . An out - of - court settlement was reached between the two parties , which involved Paramount providing the University with a significant but undisclosed sum ; as a consequence , funding was made available for eight scholarships , intended for those University athletes in need of financial assistance . Additionally , a video disclaimer was inserted in every DVD , and a written disclaimer in every book , noting that the movie was not associated with the athletic programs of the University of Toronto . As Kidd remarked , `` We hope the disclaimer will make it clear the University has no formal association with the film .
