( October 2014 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this template message ) </Td> </Tr> </Table> <P> A UCC - 1 financing statement ( an abbreviation for Uniform Commercial Code - 1 ) is a legal form that a creditor files to give notice that it has or may have an interest in the personal property of a debtor ( a person who owes a debt to the creditor as typically specified in the agreement creating the debt ) . This form is filed in order to `` perfect '' a creditor 's security interest by giving public notice that there is a right to take possession of and sell certain assets for repayment of a specific debt with a certain priority . Such notices of sale are often found in the local newspapers . Once the form has been filed , the creditor establishes a relative priority with other creditors of the debtor . This process is also called `` perfecting the security interest '' in the property , and this type of loan is a secured loan . A financing statement may also be filed in the real estate records by a lessor of fixtures to establish the priority of the lessor 's rights against a holder of a mortgage or other lien on the real property . The creditor 's rights against the debtor and the lessor 's rights against the lessee are based on the credit documents and the lease , respectively , and not the financing statement . </P> <P> Pursuant to the standards set forth in the UCC , at 9 - 503 and 9 - 504 , the financing statement need only contain three pieces of information : </P> <Ol> <Li> the debtor 's name and address </Li> <Li> the creditor 's name and address </Li> <Li> an indication of the collateral , `` whether or not it is specific , if it reasonably identifies what is described . '' ( UCC 9 - 108 ) </Li> </Ol> <P> The financing statement is generally filed with the office of the state secretary of state , in the state where the debtor is located - for an individual , the state where the debtor resides , for most kinds of business organizations the state of incorporation or organization . Many states have a state agency that operates under the secretary of state , which is tasked with overseeing business organizations and activities , including receipt of financing statements . However , an exception exists if the collateral is something that is tied to a particular piece of real property , such as timber , mineral rights , or fixtures . In that case , the filing must be made in the county where the property is located , usually in the recording office or county court , because that is where third parties are most likely to search for such record . </P> <P> In the case of a loan secured by personal property collateral , the filing of a financing statement gives notice of a lien against the property so that other lenders or buyers of the personal property will know of the security interest . In the case of a filing of a financing statement by a lessor of fixtures , the filing of the financing statement gives notice of the lessor 's interests to others who acquire an interest in the real property and related fixtures . The financing statement does not create a lien nor does it create any additional rights against a lessee in favor of a lessor , the filing of a financing statement just gives notice of whatever rights the creditor or lessor have under their loan documents or lease , respectively . </P> <H2> References ( edit ) </H2> <Ol> <Li> Jump up ^ http://www.findlegalforms.com/articles/form-encyclopedia/what-is-a-ucc1-financing-statement </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ http://biztaxlaw.about.com/od/glossaryu/g/ucc1statement.htm </Li> </Ol> Retrieved from `` https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=UCC-1_financing_statement&oldid=803697764 '' Categories : <Ul> <Li> Uniform Commercial Code </Li> <Li> Legal terminology </Li> </Ul> Hidden categories : <Ul> <Li> Articles needing additional references from October 2014 </Li> <Li> All articles needing additional references </Li> </Ul> <H2> </H2> <H3> </H3> <Ul> <Li> </Li> <Li> Talk </Li> <Li> </Li> <Li> </Li> <Li> </Li> </Ul> <H3> </H3> <Ul> <Li> </Li> <Li> </Li> </Ul> <H3> </H3> <Ul> </Ul> <H3> </H3> <Ul> <Li> </Li> <Li> </Li> <Li> </Li> </Ul> <H3> </H3> <Ul> </Ul> <H3> </H3> <H3> </H3> <Ul> <Li> </Li> <Li> </Li> <Li> </Li> <Li> </Li> <Li> </Li> <Li> </Li> <Li> </Li> </Ul> <H3> </H3> <Ul> <Li> </Li> <Li> About Wikipedia </Li> <Li> </Li> <Li> </Li> <Li> </Li> </Ul> <H3> </H3> <Ul> <Li> </Li> <Li> </Li> <Li> </Li> <Li> </Li> <Li> </Li> <Li> </Li> <Li> </Li> <Li> </Li> </Ul> <H3> </H3> <Ul> <Li> </Li> <Li> </Li> <Li> </Li> </Ul> <H3> </H3> <Ul> </Ul> Add links <Ul> <Li> This page was last edited on 4 October 2017 , at 02 : 00 . </Li> <Li> </Li> </Ul> <Ul> <Li> </Li> <Li> About Wikipedia </Li> <Li> </Li> <Li> </Li> <Li> </Li> <Li> </Li> <Li> </Li> <Li> </Li> </Ul> <Ul> <Li> </Li> <Li> </Li> </Ul>\", 'long_answer_candidates': [{'end_token': 71, 'start_token': 20, 'top_level': True}, {'end_token': 70, 'start_token': 21, 'top_level': False}, {'end_token': 309, 'start_token': 71, 'top_level': True}, {'end_token': 341, 'start_token': 309, 'top_level': True}, {'end_token': 390, 'start_token': 341, 'top_level': True}, {'end_token': 350, 'start_token': 342, 'top_level': False}, {'end_token': 358, 'start_token': 350, 'top_level': False}, {'end_token': 389, 'start_token': 358, 'top_level': False}, {'end_token': 544, 'start_token': 390, 'top_level': True}, {'end_token': 682, 'start_token': 544, 'top_level': True}], 'annotations': [{'annotation_id': 463328079900759274, 'long_answer': {'candidate_index': 2, 'end_token': 309, 'start_token': 71}, 'short_answers': [], 'yes_no_answer': 'YES'}, {'annotation_id': 5850372193022868597, 'long_answer': {'candidate_index': 8, 'end_token': 544, 'start_token': 390}, 'short_answers': [], 'yes_no_answer': 'YES'}, {'annotation_id': 6343555822642067425, 'long_answer': {'candidate_index': 2, 'end_token': 309, 'start_token': 71}, 'short_answers': [], 'yes_no_answer': 'YES'}, {'annotation_id': 592309674126071670, 'long_answer': {'candidate_index': 2, 'end_token': 309, 'start_token': 71}, 'short_answers': [], 'yes_no_answer': 'YES'}, {'annotation_id': 11945131275092237558, 'long_answer': {'candidate_index': 2, 'end_token': 309, 'start_token': 71}, 'short_answers': [], 'yes_no_answer': 'YES'}], 'indexed_chunks': [\"<wd_idx<0>> UCC - 1 financing statement - wikipedia <H1> UCC - <wd_idx<10>> 1 financing statement </H1> Jump to : navigation , search <wd_idx<20>> <Table> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> This article needs additional citations <wd_idx<30>> for verification .
