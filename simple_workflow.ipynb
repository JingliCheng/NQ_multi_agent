In its broadest sense , every email sent to a potential or current customer could be considered email marketing . It usually involves using email to send advertisements , request business , or solicit sales or donations , and is meant to build loyalty , trust , or brand awareness . Marketing emails can be sent to a purchased lead list or a current customer database . The term usually refers to sending email messages with the purpose of enhancing a merchant 's relationship with current or previous customers , encouraging customer loyalty and repeat business , acquiring new customers or convincing current customers to purchase something immediately , and sharing third - party ads . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 History </Li> <Li> 2 Types <Ul> <Li> 2.1 Transactional emails </Li> <Li> 2.2 Direct emails <Ul> <Li> 2.2. 1 Mobile email marketing </Li> </Ul> </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 3 Comparison to traditional mail <Ul> <Li> 3.1 Advantages </Li> <Li> 3.2 Disadvantages </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 4 Opt - in email advertising </Li> <Li> 5 Legal requirements <Ul> <Li> 5.1 Australia </Li> <Li> 5.2 Canada </Li> <Li> 5.3 European Union </Li> <Li> 5.4 United States </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 6 See also </Li> <Li> 7 References </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> History </H2> <P> Email marketing has evolved rapidly alongside the technological growth of the 21st century . Prior to this growth , when emails were novelties to the majority of customers , email marketing was not as effective . In 1978 , Gary Thuerk of Digital Equipment Corporation ( DEC ) sent out the first mass email to approximately 400 potential clients via the Advanced Research Projects Agency Network ( ARPANET ) . This email resulted in $13 million worth of sales in DEC products , and highlighted the potential of marketing through mass emails . However , as email marketing developed as an effective means of direct communication , users began blocking out content from emails with filters and blocking programs . In order to effectively communicate a message through email , marketers had to develop a way of pushing content through to the end user , without being cut out by automatic filters and spam removing software . This resulted in the birth of triggered marketing emails , which are sent to specific users based on their tracked online browsing patterns . </P> <P> Historically , it has been difficult to measure the effectiveness of marketing campaigns because target markets can not be adequately defined . Email marketing carries the benefit of allowing marketers to identify returns on investment and measure and improve efficiency . Email marketing allows marketers to see feedback from users in real time , and to monitor how effective their campaign is in achieving market penetration , revealing a communication channel 's scope . At the same time , however , it also means that the more personal nature of certain advertising methods , such as television advertisements , can not be captured . </P> <H2> Types </H2> <P> Email marketing can be carried out through different types of emails : </P> <H3> Transactional emails </H3> <P> Transactional emails are usually triggered based on a customer 's action with a company . To be qualified as transactional or relationship messages , these communications ' primary purpose must be `` to facilitate , complete , or confirm a commercial transaction that the recipient has previously agreed to enter into with the sender '' along with a few other narrow definitions of transactional messaging . Triggered transactional messages include dropped basket messages , password reset emails , purchase or order confirmation emails , order status emails , reorder emails , and email receipts . </P> <P> The primary purpose of a transactional email is to convey information regarding the action that triggered it . But , due to their high open rates ( 51.3 % compared to 36.6 % for email newsletters ) , transactional emails are an opportunity to introduce or extend the email relationship with customers or subscribers ; to anticipate and answer questions ; or to cross-sell or up - sell products or services . </P> <P> Many email newsletter software vendors offer transactional email support , which gives companies the ability to include promotional messages within the body of transactional emails . There are also software vendors that offer specialized transactional email marketing services , which include providing targeted and personalized transactional email messages and running specific marketing campaigns ( such as customer referral programs ) . </P> <H3> Direct emails </H3> <P> Direct email involves sending an email solely to communicate a promotional message ( for example , a special offer or a product catalog ) . Companies usually collect a list of customer or prospect email addresses to send direct promotional messages to , or they rent a list of email addresses from service companies . Safe mail marketing is also used . </P> Mobile email marketing <P> Email marketing develops large amounts of traffic through smartphones and tablets . Marketers are researching ways to advertise to more users and to make them view advertising for longer . However , the rate of delivery is still relatively low due to better filtering - out of advertising and users having multiple email accounts for different purposes . Because emails are generated according to the tracked behavior of consumers , it is possible to send advertising which is based on the recipient 's behavior . Because of this , modern email marketing is perceived more often as a pull strategy rather than a push strategy . </P> <H2> Comparison to traditional mail </H2> <P> There are both advantages and disadvantages to using email marketing in comparison to traditional advertising mail . </P> <H3> Advantages </H3> <P> Email marketing is popular with companies for several reasons : </P> <Ul> <Li> An exact return on investment can be tracked ( `` track to basket '' ) and has proven to be high when done properly . Email marketing is often reported as second only to search marketing as the most effective online marketing tactic . </Li> <Li> Email marketing is significantly cheaper and faster than traditional mail , mainly because of the high cost and time required in a traditional mail campaign for producing the artwork , printing , addressing , and mailing . </Li> <Li> Businesses and organizations who send a high volume of emails can use an ESP ( email service provider ) to gather information about the behavior of the recipients . The insights provided by consumer response to email marketing help businesses and organizations understand and make use of consumer behavior . </Li> <Li> Email provides a cost - effective method to test different marketing content , including visual , creative , marketing copy , and multimedia assets . The data gathered by testing in the email channel can then be used across all channels of marketing campaigns , both print and digital . </Li> <Li> Advertisers can reach substantial numbers of email subscribers who have opted in ( i.e. , consented ) to receive the email . </Li> <Li> Almost half of American Internet users check or send email on a typical day , with emails delivered between 1 am and 5 am local time outperforming those sent at other times in open and click rates . </Li> <Li> Email is popular with digital marketers , rising an estimated 15 % in 2009 to £ 292 million in the UK . </Li> <Li> If compared to standard email , direct email marketing produces higher response rate and higher average order value for e-commerce businesses . </Li> </Ul> <H3> Disadvantages </H3> <P> As of mid-2016 email deliverability is still an issue for legitimate marketers . According to the report , legitimate email servers averaged a delivery rate of 73 % in the U.S. ; six percent were filtered as spam , and 22 % were missing . This lags behind other countries : Australia delivers at 90 % , Canada at 89 % , Britain at 88 % , France at 84 % , Germany at 80 % and Brazil at 79 % . </P> <P> Additionally , consumers receive on average circa 90 emails per day . </P> <P> Companies considering the use of an email marketing program must make sure that their program does not violate spam laws such as the United States ' Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act ( CAN - SPAM ) , the European Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations 2003 , or their Internet service provider 's acceptable use policy . </P> <H2> Opt - in email advertising </H2> <P> Opt - in email advertising , or permission marketing , is a method of advertising via email whereby the recipient of the advertisement has consented to receive it . This method is one of several developed by marketers to eliminate the disadvantages of email marketing . </P> <P> Opt - in email marketing may evolve into a technology that uses a handshake protocol between the sender and receiver . This system is intended to eventually result in a high degree of satisfaction between consumers and marketers . If opt - in email advertising is used , the material that is emailed to consumers will be `` anticipated '' . It is assumed that the recipient wants to receive it , which makes it unlike unsolicited advertisements sent to the consumer . Ideally , opt - in email advertisements will be more personal and relevant to the consumer than untargeted advertisements . </P> <P> A common example of permission marketing is a newsletter sent to an advertising firm 's customers . Such newsletters inform customers of upcoming events or promotions , or new products . In this type of advertising , a company that wants to send a newsletter to their customers may ask them at the point of purchase if they would like to receive the newsletter . </P> <P> With a foundation of opted - in contact information stored in their database , marketers can send out promotional materials automatically using autoresponders -- known as drip marketing . They can also segment their promotions to specific market segments . </P> <H2> Legal requirements </H2> <H3> Australia </H3> <P> The Australian Spam Act 2003 is enforced by the Australian Communications and Media Authority , widely known as `` ACMA '' . The act defines the term unsolicited electronic messages , states how unsubscribe functions must work for commercial messages , and gives other key information . Fines range with 3 fines of AU $110,000 being issued to Virgin Blue Airlines ( 2011 ) , Tiger Airways Holdings Limited ( 2012 ) and Cellar master Wines Pty Limited ( 2013 ) . </P> <H3> Canada </H3> <P> The `` Canada Anti-Spam Law '' ( CASL ) went into effect on July 1 , 2014 . CASL requires an explicit or implicit opt - in from users , and the maximum fines for noncompliance are CA $ 1 million for individuals and $10 million for businesses . </P> <H3> European Union </H3> <P> In 2002 the European Union ( EU ) introduced the Directive on Privacy and Electronic Communications . Article 13 of the Directive prohibits the use of personal email addresses for marketing purposes . The Directive establishes the opt - in regime , where unsolicited emails may be sent only with prior agreement of the recipient ; this does not apply to business email addresses . </P> <P> The directive has since been incorporated into the laws of member states . In the UK it is covered under the Privacy and Electronic Communications ( EC Directive ) Regulations 2003 and applies to all organizations that send out marketing by some form of electronic communication . </P> <H3> United states </H3> <P> The CAN - SPAM Act of 2003 was passed by Congress as a direct response of the growing number of complaints over spam e-mails . Congress determined that the US government was showing an increased interest in the regulation of commercial electronic mail nationally , that those who send commercial e-mails should not mislead recipients over the source or content of them , and that all recipients of such emails have a right to decline them . The act authorizes a US $16,000 penalty per violation for spamming each individual recipient . However , it does not ban spam emailing outright , but imposes laws on using deceptive marketing methods through headings which are `` materially false or misleading '' . In addition there are conditions which email marketers must meet in terms of their format , their content and labeling . As a result , many commercial email marketers within the United States utilize a service or special software to ensure compliance with the act . A variety of older systems exist that do not ensure compliance with the act . To comply with the act 's regulation of commercial email , services also typically require users to authenticate their return address and include a valid physical address , provide a one - click unsubscribe feature , and prohibit importing lists of purchased addresses that may not have given valid permission . </P> <P> In addition to satisfying legal requirements , email service providers ( ESPs ) began to help customers establish and manage their own email marketing campaigns . The service providers supply email templates and general best practices , as well as methods for handling subscriptions and cancellations automatically . Some ESPs will provide insight and assistance with deliverability issues for major email providers . They also provide statistics pertaining to the number of messages received and opened , and whether the recipients clicked on any links within the messages . </P> <P> The CAN - SPAM Act was updated with some new regulations including a no - fee provision for opting out , further definition of `` sender '' , post office or private mail boxes count as a `` valid physical postal address '' and definition of `` person '' . These new provisions went into effect on July 7 , 2008 . </P> <H2> See also </H2> <Ul> <Li> CAUCE -- Coalition Against Unsolicited Commercial Email </Li> <Li> Customer engagement </Li> <Li> Suppression list </Li> <Li> Email spam - Unsolicited email marketing </Li> </Ul> <H2> References </H2> <Ol> <Li> Jump up ^ `` spam unsolicited e-mail '' .

In its broadest sense , every email sent to a potential or current customer could be considered email marketing . It usually involves using email to send advertisements , request business , or solicit sales or donations , and is meant to build loyalty , trust , or brand awareness . Marketing emails can be sent to a purchased lead list or a current customer database . The term usually refers to sending email messages with the purpose of enhancing a merchant 's relationship with current or previous customers , encouraging customer loyalty and repeat business , acquiring new customers or convincing current customers to purchase something immediately , and sharing third - party ads . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 History </Li> <Li> 2 Types <Ul> <Li> 2.1 Transactional emails </Li> <Li> 2.2 Direct emails <Ul> <Li> 2.2. 1 Mobile email marketing </Li> </Ul> </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 3 Comparison to traditional mail <Ul> <Li> 3.1 Advantages </Li> <Li> 3.2 Disadvantages </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 4 Opt - in email advertising </Li> <Li> 5 Legal requirements <Ul> <Li> 5.1 Australia </Li> <Li> 5.2 Canada </Li> <Li> 5.3 European Union </Li> <Li> 5.4 United States </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 6 See also </Li> <Li> 7 References </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> History </H2> <P> Email marketing has evolved rapidly alongside the technological growth of the 21st century . Prior to this growth , when emails were novelties to the majority of customers , email marketing was not as effective . In 1978 , Gary Thuerk of Digital Equipment Corporation ( DEC ) sent out the first mass email to approximately 400 potential clients via the Advanced Research Projects Agency Network ( ARPANET ) . This email resulted in $13 million worth of sales in DEC products , and highlighted the potential of marketing through mass emails . However , as email marketing developed as an effective means of direct communication , users began blocking out content from emails with filters and blocking programs . In order to effectively communicate a message through email , marketers had to develop a way of pushing content through to the end user , without being cut out by automatic filters and spam removing software . This resulted in the birth of triggered marketing emails , which are sent to specific users based on their tracked online browsing patterns . </P> <P> Historically , it has been difficult to measure the effectiveness of marketing campaigns because target markets can not be adequately defined . Email marketing carries the benefit of allowing marketers to identify returns on investment and measure and improve efficiency . Email marketing allows marketers to see feedback from users in real time , and to monitor how effective their campaign is in achieving market penetration , revealing a communication channel 's scope . At the same time , however , it also means that the more personal nature of certain advertising methods , such as television advertisements , can not be captured . </P> <H2> Types </H2> <P> Email marketing can be carried out through different types of emails : </P> <H3> Transactional emails </H3> <P> Transactional emails are usually triggered based on a customer 's action with a company . To be qualified as transactional or relationship messages , these communications ' primary purpose must be `` to facilitate , complete , or confirm a commercial transaction that the recipient has previously agreed to enter into with the sender '' along with a few other narrow definitions of transactional messaging . Triggered transactional messages include dropped basket messages , password reset emails , purchase or order confirmation emails , order status emails , reorder emails , and email receipts . </P> <P> The primary purpose of a transactional email is to convey information regarding the action that triggered it . But , due to their high open rates ( 51.3 % compared to 36.6 % for email newsletters ) , transactional emails are an opportunity to introduce or extend the email relationship with customers or subscribers ; to anticipate and answer questions ; or to cross-sell or up - sell products or services . </P> <P> Many email newsletter software vendors offer transactional email support , which gives companies the ability to include promotional messages within the body of transactional emails . There are also software vendors that offer specialized transactional email marketing services , which include providing targeted and personalized transactional email messages and running specific marketing campaigns ( such as customer referral programs ) . </P> <H3> Direct emails </H3> <P> Direct email involves sending an email solely to communicate a promotional message ( for example , a special offer or a product catalog ) . Companies usually collect a list of customer or prospect email addresses to send direct promotional messages to , or they rent a list of email addresses from service companies . Safe mail marketing is also used . </P> Mobile email marketing <P> Email marketing develops large amounts of traffic through smartphones and tablets . Marketers are researching ways to advertise to more users and to make them view advertising for longer . However , the rate of delivery is still relatively low due to better filtering - out of advertising and users having multiple email accounts for different purposes . Because emails are generated according to the tracked behavior of consumers , it is possible to send advertising which is based on the recipient 's behavior . Because of this , modern email marketing is perceived more often as a pull strategy rather than a push strategy . </P> <H2> Comparison to traditional mail </H2> <P> There are both advantages and disadvantages to using email marketing in comparison to traditional advertising mail . </P> <H3> Advantages </H3> <P> Email marketing is popular with companies for several reasons : </P> <Ul> <Li> An exact return on investment can be tracked ( `` track to basket '' ) and has proven to be high when done properly . Email marketing is often reported as second only to search marketing as the most effective online marketing tactic . </Li> <Li> Email marketing is significantly cheaper and faster than traditional mail , mainly because of the high cost and time required in a traditional mail campaign for producing the artwork , printing , addressing , and mailing . </Li> <Li> Businesses and organizations who send a high volume of emails can use an ESP ( email service provider ) to gather information about the behavior of the recipients . The insights provided by consumer response to email marketing help businesses and organizations understand and make use of consumer behavior . </Li> <Li> Email provides a cost - effective method to test different marketing content , including visual , creative , marketing copy , and multimedia assets . The data gathered by testing in the email channel can then be used across all channels of marketing campaigns , both print and digital . </Li> <Li> Advertisers can reach substantial numbers of email subscribers who have opted in ( i.e. , consented ) to receive the email . </Li> <Li> Almost half of American Internet users check or send email on a typical day , with emails delivered between 1 am and 5 am local time outperforming those sent at other times in open and click rates . </Li> <Li> Email is popular with digital marketers , rising an estimated 15 % in 2009 to £ 292 million in the UK . </Li> <Li> If compared to standard email , direct email marketing produces higher response rate and higher average order value for e-commerce businesses . </Li> </Ul> <H3> Disadvantages </H3> <P> As of mid-2016 email deliverability is still an issue for legitimate marketers . According to the report , legitimate email servers averaged a delivery rate of 73 % in the U.S. ; six percent were filtered as spam , and 22 % were missing . This lags behind other countries : Australia delivers at 90 % , Canada at 89 % , Britain at 88 % , France at 84 % , Germany at 80 % and Brazil at 79 % . </P> <P> Additionally , consumers receive on average circa 90 emails per day . </P> <P> Companies considering the use of an email marketing program must make sure that their program does not violate spam laws such as the United States ' Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act ( CAN - SPAM ) , the European Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations 2003 , or their Internet service provider 's acceptable use policy . </P> <H2> Opt - in email advertising </H2> <P> Opt - in email advertising , or permission marketing , is a method of advertising via email whereby the recipient of the advertisement has consented to receive it . This method is one of several developed by marketers to eliminate the disadvantages of email marketing . </P> <P> Opt - in email marketing may evolve into a technology that uses a handshake protocol between the sender and receiver . This system is intended to eventually result in a high degree of satisfaction between consumers and marketers . If opt - in email advertising is used , the material that is emailed to consumers will be `` anticipated '' . It is assumed that the recipient wants to receive it , which makes it unlike unsolicited advertisements sent to the consumer . Ideally , opt - in email advertisements will be more personal and relevant to the consumer than untargeted advertisements . </P> <P> A common example of permission marketing is a newsletter sent to an advertising firm 's customers . Such newsletters inform customers of upcoming events or promotions , or new products . In this type of advertising , a company that wants to send a newsletter to their customers may ask them at the point of purchase if they would like to receive the newsletter . </P> <P> With a foundation of opted - in contact information stored in their database , marketers can send out promotional materials automatically using autoresponders -- known as drip marketing . They can also segment their promotions to specific market segments . </P> <H2> Legal requirements </H2> <H3> Australia </H3> <P> The Australian Spam Act 2003 is enforced by the Australian Communications and Media Authority , widely known as `` ACMA '' . The act defines the term unsolicited electronic messages , states how unsubscribe functions must work for commercial messages , and gives other key information . Fines range with 3 fines of AU $110,000 being issued to Virgin Blue Airlines ( 2011 ) , Tiger Airways Holdings Limited ( 2012 ) and Cellar master Wines Pty Limited ( 2013 ) . </P> <H3> Canada </H3> <P> The `` Canada Anti-Spam Law '' ( CASL ) went into effect on July 1 , 2014 . CASL requires an explicit or implicit opt - in from users , and the maximum fines for noncompliance are CA $ 1 million for individuals and $10 million for businesses . </P> <H3> European Union </H3> <P> In 2002 the European Union ( EU ) introduced the Directive on Privacy and Electronic Communications . Article 13 of the Directive prohibits the use of personal email addresses for marketing purposes . The Directive establishes the opt - in regime , where unsolicited emails may be sent only with prior agreement of the recipient ; this does not apply to business email addresses . </P> <P> The directive has since been incorporated into the laws of member states . In the UK it is covered under the Privacy and Electronic Communications ( EC Directive ) Regulations 2003 and applies to all organizations that send out marketing by some form of electronic communication . </P> <H3> United states </H3> <P> The CAN - SPAM Act of 2003 was passed by Congress as a direct response of the growing number of complaints over spam e-mails . Congress determined that the US government was showing an increased interest in the regulation of commercial electronic mail nationally , that those who send commercial e-mails should not mislead recipients over the source or content of them , and that all recipients of such emails have a right to decline them . The act authorizes a US $16,000 penalty per violation for spamming each individual recipient . However , it does not ban spam emailing outright , but imposes laws on using deceptive marketing methods through headings which are `` materially false or misleading '' . In addition there are conditions which email marketers must meet in terms of their format , their content and labeling . As a result , many commercial email marketers within the United States utilize a service or special software to ensure compliance with the act . A variety of older systems exist that do not ensure compliance with the act . To comply with the act 's regulation of commercial email , services also typically require users to authenticate their return address and include a valid physical address , provide a one - click unsubscribe feature , and prohibit importing lists of purchased addresses that may not have given valid permission . </P> <P> In addition to satisfying legal requirements , email service providers ( ESPs ) began to help customers establish and manage their own email marketing campaigns . The service providers supply email templates and general best practices , as well as methods for handling subscriptions and cancellations automatically . Some ESPs will provide insight and assistance with deliverability issues for major email providers . They also provide statistics pertaining to the number of messages received and opened , and whether the recipients clicked on any links within the messages . </P> <P> The CAN - SPAM Act was updated with some new regulations including a no - fee provision for opting out , further definition of `` sender '' , post office or private mail boxes count as a `` valid physical postal address '' and definition of `` person '' . These new provisions went into effect on July 7 , 2008 . </P> <H2> See also </H2> <Ul> <Li> CAUCE -- Coalition Against Unsolicited Commercial Email </Li> <Li> Customer engagement </Li> <Li> Suppression list </Li> <Li> Email spam - Unsolicited email marketing </Li> </Ul> <H2> References </H2> <Ol> <Li> Jump up ^ `` spam unsolicited e-mail '' .

In its broadest sense , every email <wd_idx<350>> sent to a potential or current customer could be considered <wd_idx<360>> email marketing . It usually involves using email to send <wd_idx<370>> advertisements , request business , or solicit sales or donations <wd_idx<380>> , and is meant to build loyalty , trust , <wd_idx<390>> or brand awareness . Marketing emails can be sent to <wd_idx<400>> a purchased lead', \"<wd_idx<350>> sent to a potential or current customer could be considered <wd_idx<360>> email marketing .

Prior to <wd_idx<580>> this growth , when emails were novelties to the majority <wd_idx<590>> of customers , email marketing was not as effective . <wd_idx<600>> In 1978 , Gary Thuerk of Digital Equipment Corporation ( <wd_idx<610>> DEC ) sent out the first mass email to approximately <wd_idx<620>> 400 potential clients via the Advanced Research Projects Agency Network <wd_idx<630>> ( ARPANET ) . This email resulted in $13 million <wd_idx<640>> worth of sales in DEC products , and highlighted the <wd_idx<650>> potential of marketing through mass emails . However , as <wd_idx<660>> email marketing developed as an effective means of direct communication <wd_idx<670>> , users began blocking out content from emails with filters <wd_idx<680>> and blocking programs . In order to effectively communicate a <wd_idx<690>> message through email , marketers had to develop a way <wd_idx<700>> of pushing content through to the end user , without <wd_idx<710>> being cut out by automatic filters and spam removing software <wd_idx<720>> . This resulted in the birth of triggered marketing emails <wd_idx<730>> , which are sent to specific users based on their <wd_idx<740>> tracked online browsing patterns . </P> <P> Historically , it <wd_idx<750>> has been difficult to measure the effectiveness of marketing campaigns <wd_idx<760>> because target markets can not be adequately defined . Email <wd_idx<770>> marketing carries the benefit of allowing marketers to identify returns <wd_idx<780>> on investment and measure and improve efficiency . Email marketing <wd_idx<790>> allows marketers to see feedback from users in real time <wd_idx<800>> , and to monitor how effective their campaign is in <wd_idx<810>> achieving market penetration , revealing a communication channel 's scope <wd_idx<820>> . At\", \"<wd_idx<770>> marketing carries the benefit of allowing marketers to identify returns <wd_idx<780>> on investment and measure and improve efficiency . Email marketing <wd_idx<790>> allows marketers to see feedback from users in real time <wd_idx<800>> , and to monitor how effective their campaign is in <wd_idx<810>> achieving market penetration , revealing a communication channel 's scope <wd_idx<820>> . At the same time , however , it also <wd_idx<830>> means that the more personal nature of certain advertising methods <wd_idx<840>> , such as television advertisements , can not be captured <wd_idx<850>> . </P> <H2> Types </H2> <P> Email marketing can be <wd_idx<860>> carried out through different types of emails : </P> <H3> <wd_idx<870>> Transactional emails </H3> <P> Transactional emails are usually triggered based <wd_idx<880>> on a customer 's action with a company . To <wd_idx<890>> be qualified as transactional or relationship messages , these communications <wd_idx<900>> ' primary purpose must be `` to facilitate , complete <wd_idx<910>> , or confirm a commercial transaction that the recipient has <wd_idx<920>> previously agreed to enter into with the sender '' along <wd_idx<930>> with a few other narrow definitions of transactional messaging . <wd_idx<940>> Triggered transactional messages include dropped basket messages , password reset <wd_idx<950>> emails , purchase or order confirmation emails , order status <wd_idx<960>> emails , reorder emails , and email receipts . </P> <wd_idx<970>> <P> The primary purpose of a transactional email is to <wd_idx<980>> convey information regarding the action that triggered it . But <wd_idx<990>> , due to their high open rates ( 51.3 % <wd_idx<1000>> compared to 36.6 % for email newsletters ) , transactional <wd_idx<1010>> emails are an opportunity to introduce or extend the email <wd_idx<1020>> relationship with customers or subscribers ; to anticipate and answer <wd_idx<1030>> questions ; or to cross-sell or up - sell products <wd_idx<1040>> or services . </P> <P> Many email newsletter software vendors <wd_idx<1050>> offer transactional email support , which gives companies the ability <wd_idx<1060>> to include promotional messages within the body of transactional emails <wd_idx<1070>> . There are also software vendors that offer specialized transactional <wd_idx<1080>> email marketing services , which include providing targeted and personalized <wd_idx<1090>> transactional email messages and running specific marketing campaigns ( such <wd_idx<1100>> as customer referral programs ) . </P> <H3> Direct emails <wd_idx<1110>> </H3> <P> Direct email involves sending an email solely to <wd_idx<1120>> communicate a promotional message ( for example , a special <wd_idx<1130>> offer or a product catalog ) . Companies usually collect <wd_idx<1140>> a list of customer or prospect email addresses to send <wd_idx<1150>> direct promotional messages to , or they rent a list <wd_idx<1160>> of email addresses from service companies . Safe mail marketing <wd_idx<1170>> is also used . </P> Mobile email marketing <P> Email <wd_idx<1180>> marketing develops large amounts of traffic through smartphones and tablets <wd_idx<1190>> . Marketers are researching ways to advertise to more users <wd_idx<1200>> and to make them view advertising for longer . However <wd_idx<1210>> , the rate of delivery is still relatively low due <wd_idx<1220>> to better filtering - out of advertising and users having <wd_idx<1230>> multiple email accounts for different purposes . Because emails are <wd_idx<1240>> generated according to the tracked behavior of consumers , it <wd_idx<1250>> is possible to send advertising which is based on the <wd_idx<1260>> recipient 's behavior . Because of this , modern email <wd_idx<1270>> marketing is perceived more often as a pull strategy rather <wd_idx\", \"<wd_idx<1230>> multiple email accounts for different purposes .

Because of this , modern email <wd_idx<1270>> marketing is perceived more often as a pull strategy rather <wd_idx<1280>> than a push strategy . </P> <H2> Comparison to traditional <wd_idx<1290>> mail </H2> <P> There are both advantages and disadvantages to <wd_idx<1300>> using email marketing in comparison to traditional advertising mail . <wd_idx<1310>> </P> <H3> Advantages </H3> <P> Email marketing is popular with <wd_idx<1320>> companies for several reasons : </P> <Ul> <Li> An exact <wd_idx<1330>> return on investment can be tracked ( `` track to <wd_idx<1340>> basket '' ) and has proven to be high when <wd_idx<1350>> done properly . Email marketing is often reported as second <wd_idx<1360>> only to search marketing as the most effective online marketing <wd_idx<1370>> tactic . </Li> <Li> Email marketing is significantly cheaper and <wd_idx<1380>> faster than traditional mail , mainly because of the high <wd_idx<1390>> cost and time required in a traditional mail campaign for <wd_idx<1400>> producing the artwork , printing , addressing , and mailing <wd_idx<1410>> . </Li> <Li> Businesses and organizations who send a high <wd_idx<1420>> volume of emails can use an ESP ( email service <wd_idx<1430>> provider ) to gather information about the behavior of the <wd_idx<1440>> recipients . The insights provided by consumer response to email <wd_idx<1450>> marketing help businesses and organizations understand and make use of <wd_idx<1460>> consumer behavior . </Li> <Li> Email provides a cost - <wd_idx<1470>> effective method to test different marketing content , including visual <wd_idx<1480>> , creative , marketing copy , and multimedia assets . <wd_idx<1490>> The data gathered by testing in the email channel can <wd_idx<1500>> then be used across all channels of marketing campaigns , <wd_idx<1510>> both print and digital . </Li> <Li> Advertisers can reach <wd_idx<1520>> substantial numbers of email subscribers who have opted in ( <wd_idx<1530>> i.e. , consented ) to receive the email . </Li> <wd_idx<1540>> <Li> Almost half of American Internet users check or send <wd_idx<1550>> email on a typical day , with emails delivered between <wd_idx<1560>> 1 am and 5 am local time outperforming those sent <wd_idx<1570>> at other times in open and click rates . </Li> <wd_idx<1580>> <Li> Email is popular with digital marketers , rising an <wd_idx<1590>> estimated 15 % in 2009 to £ 292 million in <wd_idx<1600>> the UK . </Li> <Li> If compared to standard email <wd_idx<1610>> , direct email marketing produces higher response rate and higher <wd_idx<1620>> average order value for e-commerce businesses . </Li> </Ul> <H3> <wd_idx<1630>> Disadvantages </H3> <P> As of mid-2016 email deliverability is still <wd_idx<1640>> an issue for legitimate marketers . According to the report <wd_idx<1650>> , legitimate email servers averaged a delivery rate of 73 <wd_idx<1660>> % in the U.S. ; six percent were filtered as <wd_idx<1670>> spam , and 22 % were missing . This lags <wd_idx<1680>> behind other countries : Australia delivers at 90 % , <wd_idx<1690>> Canada at 89 % , Britain at 88 % , <wd_idx<1700>> France at 84 % , Germany at 80 % and <wd_idx<1710>> Brazil at 79 % . </P> <P> Additionally , consumers \", \"<wd_idx<1670>> spam , and 22 % were missing . This lags <wd_idx<1680>> behind other countries : Australia delivers at 90 % , <wd_idx<1690>> Canada at 89 % , Britain at 88 % , <wd_idx<1700>> France at 84 % , Germany at 80 % and <wd_idx<1710>> Brazil at 79 % . </P> <P> Additionally , consumers <wd_idx<1720>> receive on average circa 90 emails per day . </P> <wd_idx<1730>> <P> Companies considering the use of an email marketing program <wd_idx<1740>> must make sure that their program does not violate spam <wd_idx<1750>> laws such as the United States ' Controlling the Assault <wd_idx<1760>> of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act ( CAN - SPAM <wd_idx<1770>> ) , the European Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations 2003 <wd_idx<1780>> , or their Internet service provider 's acceptable use policy <wd_idx<1790>> . </P> <H2> Opt - in email advertising </H2> <P> <wd_idx<1800>> Opt - in email advertising , or permission marketing , <wd_idx<1810>> is a method of advertising via email whereby the recipient <wd_idx<1820>> of the advertisement has consented to receive it . This <wd_idx<1830>> method is one of several developed by marketers to eliminate <wd_idx<1840>> the disadvantages of email marketing . </P> <P> Opt - <wd_idx<1850>> in email marketing may evolve into a technology that uses <wd_idx<1860>> a handshake protocol between the sender and receiver . This <wd_idx<1870>> system is intended to eventually result in a high degree <wd_idx<1880>> of satisfaction between consumers and marketers . If opt - <wd_idx<1890>> in email advertising is used , the material that is <wd_idx<1900>> emailed to consumers will be `` anticipated '' . It <wd_idx<1910>> is assumed that the recipient wants to receive it , <wd_idx<1920>> which makes it unlike unsolicited advertisements sent to the consumer <wd_idx<1930>> . Ideally , opt - in email advertisements will be <wd_idx<1940>> more personal and relevant to the consumer than untargeted advertisements <wd_idx<1950>> . </P> <P> A common example of permission marketing is <wd_idx<1960>> a newsletter sent to an advertising firm 's customers . <wd_idx<1970>> Such newsletters inform customers of upcoming events or promotions , <wd_idx<1980>> or new products . In this type of advertising , <wd_idx<1990>> a company that wants to send a newsletter to their <wd_idx<2000>> customers may ask them at the point of purchase if <wd_idx<2010>> they would like to receive the newsletter . </P> <P> <wd_idx<2020>> With a foundation of opted - in contact information stored <wd_idx<2030>> in their database , marketers can send out promotional materials <wd_idx<2040>> automatically using autoresponders -- known as drip marketing . They <wd_idx<2050>> can also segment their promotions to specific market segments . <wd_idx<2060>> </P> <H2> Legal requirements </H2> <H3> Australia </H3> <P> The <wd_idx<2070>> Australian Spam Act 2003 is enforced by the Australian Communications <wd_idx<2080>> and Media Authority , widely known as `` ACMA '' <wd_idx<2090>> . The act defines the term unsolicited electronic messages , <wd_idx<2100>> states how unsubscribe functions must work for commercial messages , <wd_idx<2110>> and gives other key information . Fines range with 3 <wd_idx<2120>> fines of AU $110,000 being issued to Virgin Blue Airlines <wd_idx<2130>> ( 2011 ) , Tiger Airways Holdings Limited ( 2012 <wd_idx<2140>> ) and Cellar master Wines Pty Limited ( 2013 ) <wd_idx<2150>> . </P> <H3> Canada </H3> <P> The `` Canada Anti-Spam <wd_idx\", \"<wd_idx<2120>> fines of AU $110,000 being issued to Virgin Blue Airlines <wd_idx<2130>> ( 2011 ) , Tiger Airways Holdings Limited ( 2012 <wd_idx<2140>> ) and Cellar master Wines Pty Limited ( 2013 ) <wd_idx<2150>> . </P> <H3> Canada </H3> <P> The `` Canada Anti-Spam <wd_idx<2160>> Law '' ( CASL ) went into effect on July <wd_idx<2170>> 1 , 2014 . CASL requires an explicit or implicit <wd_idx<2180>> opt - in from users , and the maximum fines <wd_idx<2190>> for noncompliance are CA $ 1 million for individuals and <wd_idx<2200>> $10 million for businesses . </P> <H3> European Union </H3> <wd_idx<2210>> <P> In 2002 the European Union ( EU ) introduced <wd_idx<2220>> the Directive on Privacy and Electronic Communications . Article 13 <wd_idx<2230>> of the Directive prohibits the use of personal email addresses <wd_idx<2240>> for marketing purposes . The Directive establishes the opt - <wd_idx<2250>> in regime , where unsolicited emails may be sent only <wd_idx<2260>> with prior agreement of the recipient ; this does not <wd_idx<2270>> apply to business email addresses . </P> <P> The directive <wd_idx<2280>> has since been incorporated into the laws of member states <wd_idx<2290>> . In the UK it is covered under the Privacy <wd_idx<2300>> and Electronic Communications ( EC Directive ) Regulations 2003 and <wd_idx<2310>> applies to all organizations that send out marketing by some <wd_idx<2320>> form of electronic communication . </P> <H3> United states </H3> <wd_idx<2330>> <P> The CAN - SPAM Act of 2003 was passed <wd_idx<2340>> by Congress as a direct response of the growing number <wd_idx<2350>> of complaints over spam e-mails . Congress determined that the <wd_idx<2360>> US government was showing an increased interest in the regulation <wd_idx<2370>> of commercial electronic mail nationally , that those who send <wd_idx<2380>> commercial e-mails should not mislead recipients over the source or <wd_idx<2390>> content of them , and that all recipients of such <wd_idx<2400>> emails have a right to decline them . The act <wd_idx<2410>> authorizes a US $16,000 penalty per violation for spamming each <wd_idx<2420>> individual recipient . However , it does not ban spam <wd_idx<2430>> emailing outright , but imposes laws on using deceptive marketing <wd_idx<2440>> methods through headings which are `` materially false or misleading <wd_idx<2450>> '' . In addition there are conditions which email marketers <wd_idx<2460>> must meet in terms of their format , their content <wd_idx<2470>> and labeling . As a result , many commercial email <wd_idx<2480>> marketers within the United States utilize a service or special <wd_idx<2490>> software to ensure compliance with the act . A variety <wd_idx<2500>> of older systems exist that do not ensure compliance with <wd_idx<2510>> the act . To comply with the act 's regulation <wd_idx<2520>> of commercial email , services also typically require users to <wd_idx<2530>> authenticate their return address and include a valid physical address <wd_idx<2540>> , provide a one - click unsubscribe feature , and <wd_idx<2550>> prohibit importing lists of purchased addresses that may not have <wd_idx<2560>> given valid permission . </P> <P> In addition to satisfying <wd_idx<2570>> legal requirements , email service providers ( ESPs ) began <wd_idx<2580>> to help customers establish and manage their own email marketing <wd_idx<2590>> campaigns . The service providers supply email templates and general <wd_idx<2600>> best practices , as well as methods for handling subscriptions <wd_idx<2610>> and cancellations automatically .

In its broadest sense , every email sent to a potential or current customer could be considered email marketing . It usually involves using email to send advertisements , request business , or solicit sales or donations , and is meant to build loyalty , trust , or brand awareness . Marketing emails can be sent to a purchased lead list or a current customer database . The term usually refers to sending email messages with the purpose of enhancing a merchant 's relationship with current or previous customers , encouraging customer loyalty and repeat business , acquiring new customers or convincing current customers to purchase something immediately , and sharing third - party ads . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 History </Li> <Li> 2 Types <Ul> <Li> 2.1 Transactional emails </Li> <Li> 2.2 Direct emails <Ul> <Li> 2.2. 1 Mobile email marketing </Li> </Ul> </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 3 Comparison to traditional mail <Ul> <Li> 3.1 Advantages </Li> <Li> 3.2 Disadvantages </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 4 Opt - in email advertising </Li> <Li> 5 Legal requirements <Ul> <Li> 5.1 Australia </Li> <Li> 5.2 Canada </Li> <Li> 5.3 European Union </Li> <Li> 5.4 United States </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 6 See also </Li> <Li> 7 References </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> History </H2> <P> Email marketing has evolved rapidly alongside the technological growth of the 21st century . Prior to this growth , when emails were novelties to the majority of customers , email marketing was not as effective . In 1978 , Gary Thuerk of Digital Equipment Corporation ( DEC ) sent out the first mass email to approximately 400 potential clients via the Advanced Research Projects Agency Network ( ARPANET ) . This email resulted in $13 million worth of sales in DEC products , and highlighted the potential of marketing through mass emails . However , as email marketing developed as an effective means of direct communication , users began blocking out content from emails with filters and blocking programs . In order to effectively communicate a message through email , marketers had to develop a way of pushing content through to the end user , without being cut out by automatic filters and spam removing software . This resulted in the birth of triggered marketing emails , which are sent to specific users based on their tracked online browsing patterns . </P> <P> Historically , it has been difficult to measure the effectiveness of marketing campaigns because target markets can not be adequately defined . Email marketing carries the benefit of allowing marketers to identify returns on investment and measure and improve efficiency . Email marketing allows marketers to see feedback from users in real time , and to monitor how effective their campaign is in achieving market penetration , revealing a communication channel 's scope . At the same time , however , it also means that the more personal nature of certain advertising methods , such as television advertisements , can not be captured . </P> <H2> Types </H2> <P> Email marketing can be carried out through different types of emails : </P> <H3> Transactional emails </H3> <P> Transactional emails are usually triggered based on a customer 's action with a company . To be qualified as transactional or relationship messages , these communications ' primary purpose must be `` to facilitate , complete , or confirm a commercial transaction that the recipient has previously agreed to enter into with the sender '' along with a few other narrow definitions of transactional messaging . Triggered transactional messages include dropped basket messages , password reset emails , purchase or order confirmation emails , order status emails , reorder emails , and email receipts . </P> <P> The primary purpose of a transactional email is to convey information regarding the action that triggered it . But , due to their high open rates ( 51.3 % compared to 36.6 % for email newsletters ) , transactional emails are an opportunity to introduce or extend the email relationship with customers or subscribers ; to anticipate and answer questions ; or to cross-sell or up - sell products or services . </P> <P> Many email newsletter software vendors offer transactional email support , which gives companies the ability to include promotional messages within the body of transactional emails . There are also software vendors that offer specialized transactional email marketing services , which include providing targeted and personalized transactional email messages and running specific marketing campaigns ( such as customer referral programs ) . </P> <H3> Direct emails </H3> <P> Direct email involves sending an email solely to communicate a promotional message ( for example , a special offer or a product catalog ) . Companies usually collect a list of customer or prospect email addresses to send direct promotional messages to , or they rent a list of email addresses from service companies . Safe mail marketing is also used . </P> Mobile email marketing <P> Email marketing develops large amounts of traffic through smartphones and tablets . Marketers are researching ways to advertise to more users and to make them view advertising for longer . However , the rate of delivery is still relatively low due to better filtering - out of advertising and users having multiple email accounts for different purposes . Because emails are generated according to the tracked behavior of consumers , it is possible to send advertising which is based on the recipient 's behavior . Because of this , modern email marketing is perceived more often as a pull strategy rather than a push strategy . </P> <H2> Comparison to traditional mail </H2> <P> There are both advantages and disadvantages to using email marketing in comparison to traditional advertising mail . </P> <H3> Advantages </H3> <P> Email marketing is popular with companies for several reasons : </P> <Ul> <Li> An exact return on investment can be tracked ( `` track to basket '' ) and has proven to be high when done properly . Email marketing is often reported as second only to search marketing as the most effective online marketing tactic . </Li> <Li> Email marketing is significantly cheaper and faster than traditional mail , mainly because of the high cost and time required in a traditional mail campaign for producing the artwork , printing , addressing , and mailing . </Li> <Li> Businesses and organizations who send a high volume of emails can use an ESP ( email service provider ) to gather information about the behavior of the recipients . The insights provided by consumer response to email marketing help businesses and organizations understand and make use of consumer behavior . </Li> <Li> Email provides a cost - effective method to test different marketing content , including visual , creative , marketing copy , and multimedia assets . The data gathered by testing in the email channel can then be used across all channels of marketing campaigns , both print and digital . </Li> <Li> Advertisers can reach substantial numbers of email subscribers who have opted in ( i.e. , consented ) to receive the email . </Li> <Li> Almost half of American Internet users check or send email on a typical day , with emails delivered between 1 am and 5 am local time outperforming those sent at other times in open and click rates . </Li> <Li> Email is popular with digital marketers , rising an estimated 15 % in 2009 to £ 292 million in the UK . </Li> <Li> If compared to standard email , direct email marketing produces higher response rate and higher average order value for e-commerce businesses . </Li> </Ul> <H3> Disadvantages </H3> <P> As of mid-2016 email deliverability is still an issue for legitimate marketers . According to the report , legitimate email servers averaged a delivery rate of 73 % in the U.S. ; six percent were filtered as spam , and 22 % were missing . This lags behind other countries : Australia delivers at 90 % , Canada at 89 % , Britain at 88 % , France at 84 % , Germany at 80 % and Brazil at 79 % . </P> <P> Additionally , consumers receive on average circa 90 emails per day . </P> <P> Companies considering the use of an email marketing program must make sure that their program does not violate spam laws such as the United States ' Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act ( CAN - SPAM ) , the European Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations 2003 , or their Internet service provider 's acceptable use policy . </P> <H2> Opt - in email advertising </H2> <P> Opt - in email advertising , or permission marketing , is a method of advertising via email whereby the recipient of the advertisement has consented to receive it . This method is one of several developed by marketers to eliminate the disadvantages of email marketing . </P> <P> Opt - in email marketing may evolve into a technology that uses a handshake protocol between the sender and receiver . This system is intended to eventually result in a high degree of satisfaction between consumers and marketers . If opt - in email advertising is used , the material that is emailed to consumers will be `` anticipated '' . It is assumed that the recipient wants to receive it , which makes it unlike unsolicited advertisements sent to the consumer . Ideally , opt - in email advertisements will be more personal and relevant to the consumer than untargeted advertisements . </P> <P> A common example of permission marketing is a newsletter sent to an advertising firm 's customers . Such newsletters inform customers of upcoming events or promotions , or new products . In this type of advertising , a company that wants to send a newsletter to their customers may ask them at the point of purchase if they would like to receive the newsletter . </P> <P> With a foundation of opted - in contact information stored in their database , marketers can send out promotional materials automatically using autoresponders -- known as drip marketing . They can also segment their promotions to specific market segments . </P> <H2> Legal requirements </H2> <H3> Australia </H3> <P> The Australian Spam Act 2003 is enforced by the Australian Communications and Media Authority , widely known as `` ACMA '' . The act defines the term unsolicited electronic messages , states how unsubscribe functions must work for commercial messages , and gives other key information . Fines range with 3 fines of AU $110,000 being issued to Virgin Blue Airlines ( 2011 ) , Tiger Airways Holdings Limited ( 2012 ) and Cellar master Wines Pty Limited ( 2013 ) . </P> <H3> Canada </H3> <P> The `` Canada Anti-Spam Law '' ( CASL ) went into effect on July 1 , 2014 . CASL requires an explicit or implicit opt - in from users , and the maximum fines for noncompliance are CA $ 1 million for individuals and $10 million for businesses . </P> <H3> European Union </H3> <P> In 2002 the European Union ( EU ) introduced the Directive on Privacy and Electronic Communications . Article 13 of the Directive prohibits the use of personal email addresses for marketing purposes . The Directive establishes the opt - in regime , where unsolicited emails may be sent only with prior agreement of the recipient ; this does not apply to business email addresses . </P> <P> The directive has since been incorporated into the laws of member states . In the UK it is covered under the Privacy and Electronic Communications ( EC Directive ) Regulations 2003 and applies to all organizations that send out marketing by some form of electronic communication . </P> <H3> United states </H3> <P> The CAN - SPAM Act of 2003 was passed by Congress as a direct response of the growing number of complaints over spam e-mails . Congress determined that the US government was showing an increased interest in the regulation of commercial electronic mail nationally , that those who send commercial e-mails should not mislead recipients over the source or content of them , and that all recipients of such emails have a right to decline them . The act authorizes a US $16,000 penalty per violation for spamming each individual recipient . However , it does not ban spam emailing outright , but imposes laws on using deceptive marketing methods through headings which are `` materially false or misleading '' . In addition there are conditions which email marketers must meet in terms of their format , their content and labeling . As a result , many commercial email marketers within the United States utilize a service or special software to ensure compliance with the act . A variety of older systems exist that do not ensure compliance with the act . To comply with the act 's regulation of commercial email , services also typically require users to authenticate their return address and include a valid physical address , provide a one - click unsubscribe feature , and prohibit importing lists of purchased addresses that may not have given valid permission . </P> <P> In addition to satisfying legal requirements , email service providers ( ESPs ) began to help customers establish and manage their own email marketing campaigns . The service providers supply email templates and general best practices , as well as methods for handling subscriptions and cancellations automatically .

In its broadest sense , every email <wd_idx<350>> sent to a potential or current customer could be considered <wd_idx<360>> email marketing . It usually involves using email to send <wd_idx<370>> advertisements , request business , or solicit sales or donations <wd_idx<380>> , and is meant to build loyalty , trust , <wd_idx<390>> or brand awareness .

Prior to <wd_idx<580>> this growth , when emails were novelties to the majority <wd_idx<590>> of customers , email marketing was not as effective . <wd_idx<600>> In 1978 , Gary Thuerk of Digital Equipment Corporation ( <wd_idx<610>> DEC ) sent out the first mass email to approximately <wd_idx<620>> 400 potential clients via the Advanced Research Projects Agency Network <wd_idx<630>> ( ARPANET ) . This email resulted in $13 million <wd_idx<640>> worth of sales in DEC products , and highlighted the <wd_idx<650>> potential of marketing through mass emails . However , as <wd_idx<660>> email marketing developed as an effective means of direct communication <wd_idx<670>> , users began blocking out content from emails with filters <wd_idx<680>> and blocking programs . In order to effectively communicate a <wd_idx<690>> message through email , marketers had to develop a way <wd_idx<700>> of pushing content through to the end user , without <wd_idx<710>> being cut out by automatic filters and spam removing software <wd_idx<720>> . This resulted in the birth of triggered marketing emails <wd_idx<730>> , which are sent to specific users based on their <wd_idx<740>> tracked online browsing patterns . </P> <P> Historically , it <wd_idx<750>> has been difficult to measure the effectiveness of marketing campaigns <wd_idx<760>> because target markets can not be adequately defined . Email <wd_idx<770>> marketing carries the benefit of allowing marketers to identify returns <wd_idx<780>> on investment and measure and improve efficiency . Email marketing <wd_idx<790>> allows marketers to see feedback from users in real time <wd_idx<800>> , and to monitor how effective their campaign is in <wd_idx<810>> achieving market penetration , revealing a communication channel 's scope <wd_idx<820>> . At\", \"<wd_idx<770>> marketing carries the benefit of allowing marketers to identify returns <wd_idx<780>> on investment and measure and improve efficiency . Email marketing <wd_idx<790>> allows marketers to see feedback from users in real time <wd_idx<800>> , and to monitor how effective their campaign is in <wd_idx<810>> achieving market penetration , revealing a communication channel 's scope <wd_idx<820>> . At the same time , however , it also <wd_idx<830>> means that the more personal nature of certain advertising methods <wd_idx<840>> , such as television advertisements , can not be captured <wd_idx<850>> . </P> <H2> Types </H2> <P> Email marketing can be <wd_idx<860>> carried out through different types of emails : </P> <H3> <wd_idx<870>> Transactional emails </H3> <P> Transactional emails are usually triggered based <wd_idx<880>> on a customer 's action with a company . To <wd_idx<890>> be qualified as transactional or relationship messages , these communications <wd_idx<900>> ' primary purpose must be `` to facilitate , complete <wd_idx<910>> , or confirm a commercial transaction that the recipient has <wd_idx<920>> previously agreed to enter into with the sender '' along <wd_idx<930>> with a few other narrow definitions of transactional messaging . <wd_idx<940>> Triggered transactional messages include dropped basket messages , password reset <wd_idx<950>> emails , purchase or order confirmation emails , order status <wd_idx<960>> emails , reorder emails , and email receipts . </P> <wd_idx<970>> <P> The primary purpose of a transactional email is to <wd_idx<980>> convey information regarding the action that triggered it . But <wd_idx<990>> , due to their high open rates ( 51.3 % <wd_idx<1000>> compared to 36.6 % for email newsletters ) , transactional <wd_idx<1010>> emails are an opportunity to introduce or extend the email <wd_idx<1020>> relationship with customers or subscribers ; to anticipate and answer <wd_idx<1030>> questions ; or to cross-sell or up - sell products <wd_idx<1040>> or services . </P> <P> Many email newsletter software vendors <wd_idx<1050>> offer transactional email support , which gives companies the ability <wd_idx<1060>> to include promotional messages within the body of transactional emails <wd_idx<1070>> . There are also software vendors that offer specialized transactional <wd_idx<1080>> email marketing services , which include providing targeted and personalized <wd_idx<1090>> transactional email messages and running specific marketing campaigns ( such <wd_idx<1100>> as customer referral programs ) . </P> <H3> Direct emails <wd_idx<1110>> </H3> <P> Direct email involves sending an email solely to <wd_idx<1120>> communicate a promotional message ( for example , a special <wd_idx<1130>> offer or a product catalog ) . Companies usually collect <wd_idx<1140>> a list of customer or prospect email addresses to send <wd_idx<1150>> direct promotional messages to , or they rent a list <wd_idx<1160>> of email addresses from service companies . Safe mail marketing <wd_idx<1170>> is also used . </P> Mobile email marketing <P> Email <wd_idx<1180>> marketing develops large amounts of traffic through smartphones and tablets <wd_idx<1190>> . Marketers are researching ways to advertise to more users <wd_idx<1200>> and to make them view advertising for longer . However <wd_idx<1210>> , the rate of delivery is still relatively low due <wd_idx<1220>> to better filtering - out of advertising and users having <wd_idx<1230>> multiple email accounts for different purposes . Because emails are <wd_idx<1240>> generated according to the tracked behavior of consumers , it <wd_idx<1250>> is possible to send advertising which is based on the <wd_idx<1260>> recipient 's behavior . Because of this , modern email <wd_idx<1270>> marketing is perceived more often as a pull strategy rather <wd_idx\", \"<wd_idx<1230>> multiple email accounts for different purposes .

Because of this , modern email <wd_idx<1270>> marketing is perceived more often as a pull strategy rather <wd_idx<1280>> than a push strategy . </P> <H2> Comparison to traditional <wd_idx<1290>> mail </H2> <P> There are both advantages and disadvantages to <wd_idx<1300>> using email marketing in comparison to traditional advertising mail . <wd_idx<1310>> </P> <H3> Advantages </H3> <P> Email marketing is popular with <wd_idx<1320>> companies for several reasons : </P> <Ul> <Li> An exact <wd_idx<1330>> return on investment can be tracked ( `` track to <wd_idx<1340>> basket '' ) and has proven to be high when <wd_idx<1350>> done properly . Email marketing is often reported as second <wd_idx<1360>> only to search marketing as the most effective online marketing <wd_idx<1370>> tactic . </Li> <Li> Email marketing is significantly cheaper and <wd_idx<1380>> faster than traditional mail , mainly because of the high <wd_idx<1390>> cost and time required in a traditional mail campaign for <wd_idx<1400>> producing the artwork , printing , addressing , and mailing <wd_idx<1410>> . </Li> <Li> Businesses and organizations who send a high <wd_idx<1420>> volume of emails can use an ESP ( email service <wd_idx<1430>> provider ) to gather information about the behavior of the <wd_idx<1440>> recipients . The insights provided by consumer response to email <wd_idx<1450>> marketing help businesses and organizations understand and make use of <wd_idx<1460>> consumer behavior . </Li> <Li> Email provides a cost - <wd_idx<1470>> effective method to test different marketing content , including visual <wd_idx<1480>> , creative , marketing copy , and multimedia assets . <wd_idx<1490>> The data gathered by testing in the email channel can <wd_idx<1500>> then be used across all channels of marketing campaigns , <wd_idx<1510>> both print and digital . </Li> <Li> Advertisers can reach <wd_idx<1520>> substantial numbers of email subscribers who have opted in ( <wd_idx<1530>> i.e. , consented ) to receive the email . </Li> <wd_idx<1540>> <Li> Almost half of American Internet users check or send <wd_idx<1550>> email on a typical day , with emails delivered between <wd_idx<1560>> 1 am and 5 am local time outperforming those sent <wd_idx<1570>> at other times in open and click rates . </Li> <wd_idx<1580>> <Li> Email is popular with digital marketers , rising an <wd_idx<1590>> estimated 15 % in 2009 to £ 292 million in <wd_idx<1600>> the UK . </Li> <Li> If compared to standard email <wd_idx<1610>> , direct email marketing produces higher response rate and higher <wd_idx<1620>> average order value for e-commerce businesses . </Li> </Ul> <H3> <wd_idx<1630>> Disadvantages </H3> <P> As of mid-2016 email deliverability is still <wd_idx<1640>> an issue for legitimate marketers . According to the report <wd_idx<1650>> , legitimate email servers averaged a delivery rate of 73 <wd_idx<1660>> % in the U.S. ; six percent were filtered as <wd_idx<1670>> spam , and 22 % were missing . This lags <wd_idx<1680>> behind other countries : Australia delivers at 90 % , <wd_idx<1690>> Canada at 89 % , Britain at 88 % , <wd_idx<1700>> France at 84 % , Germany at 80 % and <wd_idx<1710>> Brazil at 79 % . </P> <P> Additionally , consumers \", \"<wd_idx<1670>> spam , and 22 % were missing . This lags <wd_idx<1680>> behind other countries : Australia delivers at 90 % , <wd_idx<1690>> Canada at 89 % , Britain at 88 % , <wd_idx<1700>> France at 84 % , Germany at 80 % and <wd_idx<1710>> Brazil at 79 % . </P> <P> Additionally , consumers <wd_idx<1720>> receive on average circa 90 emails per day . </P> <wd_idx<1730>> <P> Companies considering the use of an email marketing program <wd_idx<1740>> must make sure that their program does not violate spam <wd_idx<1750>> laws such as the United States ' Controlling the Assault <wd_idx<1760>> of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act ( CAN - SPAM <wd_idx<1770>> ) , the European Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations 2003 <wd_idx<1780>> , or their Internet service provider 's acceptable use policy <wd_idx<1790>> . </P> <H2> Opt - in email advertising </H2> <P> <wd_idx<1800>> Opt - in email advertising , or permission marketing , <wd_idx<1810>> is a method of advertising via email whereby the recipient <wd_idx<1820>> of the advertisement has consented to receive it . This <wd_idx<1830>> method is one of several developed by marketers to eliminate <wd_idx<1840>> the disadvantages of email marketing . </P> <P> Opt - <wd_idx<1850>> in email marketing may evolve into a technology that uses <wd_idx<1860>> a handshake protocol between the sender and receiver . This <wd_idx<1870>> system is intended to eventually result in a high degree <wd_idx<1880>> of satisfaction between consumers and marketers . If opt - <wd_idx<1890>> in email advertising is used , the material that is <wd_idx<1900>> emailed to consumers will be `` anticipated '' . It <wd_idx<1910>> is assumed that the recipient wants to receive it , <wd_idx<1920>> which makes it unlike unsolicited advertisements sent to the consumer <wd_idx<1930>> . Ideally , opt - in email advertisements will be <wd_idx<1940>> more personal and relevant to the consumer than untargeted advertisements <wd_idx<1950>> . </P> <P> A common example of permission marketing is <wd_idx<1960>> a newsletter sent to an advertising firm 's customers . <wd_idx<1970>> Such newsletters inform customers of upcoming events or promotions , <wd_idx<1980>> or new products . In this type of advertising , <wd_idx<1990>> a company that wants to send a newsletter to their <wd_idx<2000>> customers may ask them at the point of purchase if <wd_idx<2010>> they would like to receive the newsletter . </P> <P> <wd_idx<2020>> With a foundation of opted - in contact information stored <wd_idx<2030>> in their database , marketers can send out promotional materials <wd_idx<2040>> automatically using autoresponders -- known as drip marketing . They <wd_idx<2050>> can also segment their promotions to specific market segments . <wd_idx<2060>> </P> <H2> Legal requirements </H2> <H3> Australia </H3> <P> The <wd_idx<2070>> Australian Spam Act 2003 is enforced by the Australian Communications <wd_idx<2080>> and Media Authority , widely known as `` ACMA '' <wd_idx<2090>> . The act defines the term unsolicited electronic messages , <wd_idx<2100>> states how unsubscribe functions must work for commercial messages , <wd_idx<2110>> and gives other key information . Fines range with 3 <wd_idx<2120>> fines of AU $110,000 being issued to Virgin Blue Airlines <wd_idx<2130>> ( 2011 ) , Tiger Airways Holdings Limited ( 2012 <wd_idx<2140>> ) and Cellar master Wines Pty Limited ( 2013 ) <wd_idx<2150>> . </P> <H3> Canada </H3> <P> The `` Canada Anti-Spam <wd_idx\", \"<wd_idx<2120>> fines of AU $110,000 being issued to Virgin Blue Airlines <wd_idx<2130>> ( 2011 ) , Tiger Airways Holdings Limited ( 2012 <wd_idx<2140>> ) and Cellar master Wines Pty Limited ( 2013 ) <wd_idx<2150>> . </P> <H3> Canada </H3> <P> The `` Canada Anti-Spam <wd_idx<2160>> Law '' ( CASL ) went into effect on July <wd_idx<2170>> 1 , 2014 . CASL requires an explicit or implicit <wd_idx<2180>> opt - in from users , and the maximum fines <wd_idx<2190>> for noncompliance are CA $ 1 million for individuals and <wd_idx<2200>> $10 million for businesses . </P> <H3> European Union </H3> <wd_idx<2210>> <P> In 2002 the European Union ( EU ) introduced <wd_idx<2220>> the Directive on Privacy and Electronic Communications . Article 13 <wd_idx<2230>> of the Directive prohibits the use of personal email addresses <wd_idx<2240>> for marketing purposes . The Directive establishes the opt - <wd_idx<2250>> in regime , where unsolicited emails may be sent only <wd_idx<2260>> with prior agreement of the recipient ; this does not <wd_idx<2270>> apply to business email addresses . </P> <P> The directive <wd_idx<2280>> has since been incorporated into the laws of member states <wd_idx<2290>> . In the UK it is covered under the Privacy <wd_idx<2300>> and Electronic Communications ( EC Directive ) Regulations 2003 and <wd_idx<2310>> applies to all organizations that send out marketing by some <wd_idx<2320>> form of electronic communication . </P> <H3> United states </H3> <wd_idx<2330>> <P> The CAN - SPAM Act of 2003 was passed <wd_idx<2340>> by Congress as a direct response of the growing number <wd_idx<2350>> of complaints over spam e-mails . Congress determined that the <wd_idx<2360>> US government was showing an increased interest in the regulation <wd_idx<2370>> of commercial electronic mail nationally , that those who send <wd_idx<2380>> commercial e-mails should not mislead recipients over the source or <wd_idx<2390>> content of them , and that all recipients of such <wd_idx<2400>> emails have a right to decline them . The act <wd_idx<2410>> authorizes a US $16,000 penalty per violation for spamming each <wd_idx<2420>> individual recipient . However , it does not ban spam <wd_idx<2430>> emailing outright , but imposes laws on using deceptive marketing <wd_idx<2440>> methods through headings which are `` materially false or misleading <wd_idx<2450>> '' . In addition there are conditions which email marketers <wd_idx<2460>> must meet in terms of their format , their content <wd_idx<2470>> and labeling . As a result , many commercial email <wd_idx<2480>> marketers within the United States utilize a service or special <wd_idx<2490>> software to ensure compliance with the act . A variety <wd_idx<2500>> of older systems exist that do not ensure compliance with <wd_idx<2510>> the act . To comply with the act 's regulation <wd_idx<2520>> of commercial email , services also typically require users to <wd_idx<2530>> authenticate their return address and include a valid physical address <wd_idx<2540>> , provide a one - click unsubscribe feature , and <wd_idx<2550>> prohibit importing lists of purchased addresses that may not have <wd_idx<2560>> given valid permission . </P> <P> In addition to satisfying <wd_idx<2570>> legal requirements , email service providers ( ESPs ) began <wd_idx<2580>> to help customers establish and manage their own email marketing <wd_idx<2590>> campaigns . The service providers supply email templates and general <wd_idx<2600>> best practices , as well as methods for handling subscriptions <wd_idx<2610>> and cancellations automatically . Some ESPs will provide insight and <wd_\", \"<wd_idx<2570>> legal requirements , email service providers ( ESPs ) began <wd_idx<2580>> to help customers establish and manage their own email marketing <wd_idx<2590>> campaigns .

Some ESPs will provide insight and <wd_idx<2620>> assistance with deliverability issues for major email providers . They <wd_idx<2630>> also provide statistics pertaining to the number of messages received <wd_idx<2640>> and opened , and whether the recipients clicked on any <wd_idx<2650>> links within the messages . </P> <P> The CAN - <wd_idx<2660>> SPAM Act was updated with some new regulations including a <wd_idx<2670>> no - fee provision for opting out , further definition <wd_idx<2680>> of `` sender '' , post office or private mail <wd_idx<2690>> boxes count as a `` valid physical postal address '' <wd_idx<2700>> and definition of `` person '' .

In its broadest sense , every email sent to a potential or current customer could be considered email marketing . It usually involves using email to send advertisements , request business , or solicit sales or donations , and is meant to build loyalty , trust , or brand awareness . Marketing emails can be sent to a purchased lead list or a current customer database . The term usually refers to sending email messages with the purpose of enhancing a merchant 's relationship with current or previous customers , encouraging customer loyalty and repeat business , acquiring new customers or convincing current customers to purchase something immediately , and sharing third - party ads . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 History </Li> <Li> 2 Types <Ul> <Li> 2.1 Transactional emails </Li> <Li> 2.2 Direct emails <Ul> <Li> 2.2. 1 Mobile email marketing </Li> </Ul> </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 3 Comparison to traditional mail <Ul> <Li> 3.1 Advantages </Li> <Li> 3.2 Disadvantages </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 4 Opt - in email advertising </Li> <Li> 5 Legal requirements <Ul> <Li> 5.1 Australia </Li> <Li> 5.2 Canada </Li> <Li> 5.3 European Union </Li> <Li> 5.4 United States </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 6 See also </Li> <Li> 7 References </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> History </H2> <P> Email marketing has evolved rapidly alongside the technological growth of the 21st century . Prior to this growth , when emails were novelties to the majority of customers , email marketing was not as effective . In 1978 , Gary Thuerk of Digital Equipment Corporation ( DEC ) sent out the first mass email to approximately 400 potential clients via the Advanced Research Projects Agency Network ( ARPANET ) . This email resulted in $13 million worth of sales in DEC products , and highlighted the potential of marketing through mass emails . However , as email marketing developed as an effective means of direct communication , users began blocking out content from emails with filters and blocking programs . In order to effectively communicate a message through email , marketers had to develop a way of pushing content through to the end user , without being cut out by automatic filters and spam removing software . This resulted in the birth of triggered marketing emails , which are sent to specific users based on their tracked online browsing patterns . </P> <P> Historically , it has been difficult to measure the effectiveness of marketing campaigns because target markets can not be adequately defined . Email marketing carries the benefit of allowing marketers to identify returns on investment and measure and improve efficiency . Email marketing allows marketers to see feedback from users in real time , and to monitor how effective their campaign is in achieving market penetration , revealing a communication channel 's scope . At the same time , however , it also means that the more personal nature of certain advertising methods , such as television advertisements , can not be captured . </P> <H2> Types </H2> <P> Email marketing can be carried out through different types of emails : </P> <H3> Transactional emails </H3> <P> Transactional emails are usually triggered based on a customer 's action with a company . To be qualified as transactional or relationship messages , these communications ' primary purpose must be `` to facilitate , complete , or confirm a commercial transaction that the recipient has previously agreed to enter into with the sender '' along with a few other narrow definitions of transactional messaging . Triggered transactional messages include dropped basket messages , password reset emails , purchase or order confirmation emails , order status emails , reorder emails , and email receipts . </P> <P> The primary purpose of a transactional email is to convey information regarding the action that triggered it . But , due to their high open rates ( 51.3 % compared to 36.6 % for email newsletters ) , transactional emails are an opportunity to introduce or extend the email relationship with customers or subscribers ; to anticipate and answer questions ; or to cross-sell or up - sell products or services . </P> <P> Many email newsletter software vendors offer transactional email support , which gives companies the ability to include promotional messages within the body of transactional emails . There are also software vendors that offer specialized transactional email marketing services , which include providing targeted and personalized transactional email messages and running specific marketing campaigns ( such as customer referral programs ) . </P> <H3> Direct emails </H3> <P> Direct email involves sending an email solely to communicate a promotional message ( for example , a special offer or a product catalog ) . Companies usually collect a list of customer or prospect email addresses to send direct promotional messages to , or they rent a list of email addresses from service companies . Safe mail marketing is also used . </P> Mobile email marketing <P> Email marketing develops large amounts of traffic through smartphones and tablets . Marketers are researching ways to advertise to more users and to make them view advertising for longer . However , the rate of delivery is still relatively low due to better filtering - out of advertising and users having multiple email accounts for different purposes . Because emails are generated according to the tracked behavior of consumers , it is possible to send advertising which is based on the recipient 's behavior . Because of this , modern email marketing is perceived more often as a pull strategy rather than a push strategy . </P> <H2> Comparison to traditional mail </H2> <P> There are both advantages and disadvantages to using email marketing in comparison to traditional advertising mail . </P> <H3> Advantages </H3> <P> Email marketing is popular with companies for several reasons : </P> <Ul> <Li> An exact return on investment can be tracked ( `` track to basket '' ) and has proven to be high when done properly . Email marketing is often reported as second only to search marketing as the most effective online marketing tactic . </Li> <Li> Email marketing is significantly cheaper and faster than traditional mail , mainly because of the high cost and time required in a traditional mail campaign for producing the artwork , printing , addressing , and mailing . </Li> <Li> Businesses and organizations who send a high volume of emails can use an ESP ( email service provider ) to gather information about the behavior of the recipients . The insights provided by consumer response to email marketing help businesses and organizations understand and make use of consumer behavior . </Li> <Li> Email provides a cost - effective method to test different marketing content , including visual , creative , marketing copy , and multimedia assets . The data gathered by testing in the email channel can then be used across all channels of marketing campaigns , both print and digital . </Li> <Li> Advertisers can reach substantial numbers of email subscribers who have opted in ( i.e. , consented ) to receive the email . </Li> <Li> Almost half of American Internet users check or send email on a typical day , with emails delivered between 1 am and 5 am local time outperforming those sent at other times in open and click rates . </Li> <Li> Email is popular with digital marketers , rising an estimated 15 % in 2009 to £ 292 million in the UK . </Li> <Li> If compared to standard email , direct email marketing produces higher response rate and higher average order value for e-commerce businesses . </Li> </Ul> <H3> Disadvantages </H3> <P> As of mid-2016 email deliverability is still an issue for legitimate marketers . According to the report , legitimate email servers averaged a delivery rate of 73 % in the U.S. ; six percent were filtered as spam , and 22 % were missing . This lags behind other countries : Australia delivers at 90 % , Canada at 89 % , Britain at 88 % , France at 84 % , Germany at 80 % and Brazil at 79 % . </P> <P> Additionally , consumers receive on average circa 90 emails per day . </P> <P> Companies considering the use of an email marketing program must make sure that their program does not violate spam laws such as the United States ' Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act ( CAN - SPAM ) , the European Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations 2003 , or their Internet service provider 's acceptable use policy . </P> <H2> Opt - in email advertising </H2> <P> Opt - in email advertising , or permission marketing , is a method of advertising via email whereby the recipient of the advertisement has consented to receive it . This method is one of several developed by marketers to eliminate the disadvantages of email marketing . </P> <P> Opt - in email marketing may evolve into a technology that uses a handshake protocol between the sender and receiver . This system is intended to eventually result in a high degree of satisfaction between consumers and marketers . If opt - in email advertising is used , the material that is emailed to consumers will be `` anticipated '' . It is assumed that the recipient wants to receive it , which makes it unlike unsolicited advertisements sent to the consumer . Ideally , opt - in email advertisements will be more personal and relevant to the consumer than untargeted advertisements . </P> <P> A common example of permission marketing is a newsletter sent to an advertising firm 's customers . Such newsletters inform customers of upcoming events or promotions , or new products . In this type of advertising , a company that wants to send a newsletter to their customers may ask them at the point of purchase if they would like to receive the newsletter . </P> <P> With a foundation of opted - in contact information stored in their database , marketers can send out promotional materials automatically using autoresponders -- known as drip marketing . They can also segment their promotions to specific market segments . </P> <H2> Legal requirements </H2> <H3> Australia </H3> <P> The Australian Spam Act 2003 is enforced by the Australian Communications and Media Authority , widely known as `` ACMA '' . The act defines the term unsolicited electronic messages , states how unsubscribe functions must work for commercial messages , and gives other key information . Fines range with 3 fines of AU $110,000 being issued to Virgin Blue Airlines ( 2011 ) , Tiger Airways Holdings Limited ( 2012 ) and Cellar master Wines Pty Limited ( 2013 ) . </P> <H3> Canada </H3> <P> The `` Canada Anti-Spam Law '' ( CASL ) went into effect on July 1 , 2014 . CASL requires an explicit or implicit opt - in from users , and the maximum fines for noncompliance are CA $ 1 million for individuals and $10 million for businesses . </P> <H3> European Union </H3> <P> In 2002 the European Union ( EU ) introduced the Directive on Privacy and Electronic Communications . Article 13 of the Directive prohibits the use of personal email addresses for marketing purposes . The Directive establishes the opt - in regime , where unsolicited emails may be sent only with prior agreement of the recipient ; this does not apply to business email addresses . </P> <P> The directive has since been incorporated into the laws of member states . In the UK it is covered under the Privacy and Electronic Communications ( EC Directive ) Regulations 2003 and applies to all organizations that send out marketing by some form of electronic communication . </P> <H3> United states </H3> <P> The CAN - SPAM Act of 2003 was passed by Congress as a direct response of the growing number of complaints over spam e-mails . Congress determined that the US government was showing an increased interest in the regulation of commercial electronic mail nationally , that those who send commercial e-mails should not mislead recipients over the source or content of them , and that all recipients of such emails have a right to decline them . The act authorizes a US $16,000 penalty per violation for spamming each individual recipient . However , it does not ban spam emailing outright , but imposes laws on using deceptive marketing methods through headings which are `` materially false or misleading '' . In addition there are conditions which email marketers must meet in terms of their format , their content and labeling . As a result , many commercial email marketers within the United States utilize a service or special software to ensure compliance with the act . A variety of older systems exist that do not ensure compliance with the act . To comply with the act 's regulation of commercial email , services also typically require users to authenticate their return address and include a valid physical address , provide a one - click unsubscribe feature , and prohibit importing lists of purchased addresses that may not have given valid permission . </P> <P> In addition to satisfying legal requirements , email service providers ( ESPs ) began to help customers establish and manage their own email marketing campaigns . The service providers supply email templates and general best practices , as well as methods for handling subscriptions and cancellations automatically . Some ESPs will provide insight and assistance with deliverability issues for major email providers . They also provide statistics pertaining to the number of messages received and opened , and whether the recipients clicked on any links within the messages . </P> <P> The CAN - SPAM Act was updated with some new regulations including a no - fee provision for opting out , further definition of `` sender '' , post office or private mail boxes count as a `` valid physical postal address '' and definition of `` person '' . These new provisions went into effect on July 7 , 2008 . </P> <H2> See also </H2> <Ul> <Li> CAUCE -- Coalition Against Unsolicited Commercial Email </Li> <Li> Customer engagement </Li> <Li> Suppression list </Li> <Li> Email spam - Unsolicited email marketing </Li> </Ul> <H2> References </H2> <Ol> <Li> Jump up ^ `` spam unsolicited e-mail '' .

Email marketing is often reported as second <wd_idx<1360>> only to search marketing as the most effective online marketing <wd_idx<1370>> tactic . </Li> <Li> Email marketing is significantly cheaper and <wd_idx<1380>> faster than traditional mail , mainly because of the high <wd_idx<1390>> cost and time required in a traditional mail campaign for <wd_idx<1400>> producing the artwork , printing , addressing , and mailing <wd_idx<1410>> . </Li> <Li> Businesses and organizations who send a high <wd_idx<1420>> volume of emails can use an ESP ( email service <wd_idx<1430>> provider ) to gather information about the behavior of the <wd_idx<1440>> recipients . The insights provided by consumer response to email <wd_idx<1450>> marketing help businesses and organizations understand and make use of <wd_idx<1460>> consumer behavior . </Li> <Li> Email provides a cost - <wd_idx<1470>> effective method to test different marketing content , including visual <wd_idx<1480>> , creative , marketing copy , and multimedia assets . <wd_idx<1490>> The data gathered by testing in the email channel can <wd_idx<1500>> then be used across all channels of marketing campaigns , <wd_idx<1510>> both print and digital . </Li> <Li> Advertisers can reach <wd_idx<1520>> substantial numbers of email subscribers who have opted in ( <wd_idx<1530>> i.e. , consented ) to receive the email . </Li> <wd_idx<1540>> <Li> Almost half of American Internet users check or send <wd_idx<1550>> email on a typical day , with emails delivered between <wd_idx<1560>> 1 am and 5 am local time outperforming those sent <wd_idx<1570>> at other times in open and click rates . </Li> <wd_idx<1580>> <Li> Email is popular with digital marketers , rising an <wd_idx<1590>> estimated 15 % in 2009 to £ 292 million in <wd_idx<1600>> the UK . </Li> <Li> If compared to standard email <wd_idx<1610>> , direct email marketing produces higher response rate and higher <wd_idx<1620>> average order value for e-commerce businesses . </Li> </Ul> <H3> <wd_idx<1630>> Disadvantages </H3> <P> As of mid-2016 email deliverability is still <wd_idx<1640>> an issue for legitimate marketers . According to the report <wd_idx<1650>> , legitimate email servers averaged a delivery rate of 73 <wd_idx<1660>> % in the U.S. ; six percent were filtered as <wd_idx<1670>> spam , and 22 % were missing . This lags <wd_idx<1680>> behind other countries : Australia delivers at 90 % , <wd_idx<1690>> Canada at 89 % , Britain at 88 % , <wd_idx<1700>> France at 84 % , Germany at 80 % and <wd_idx<1710>> Brazil at 79 % . </P> <P> Additionally , consumers \", \"<wd_idx<1670>> spam , and 22 % were missing . This lags <wd_idx<1680>> behind other countries : Australia delivers at 90 % , <wd_idx<1690>> Canada at 89 % , Britain at 88 % , <wd_idx<1700>> France at 84 % , Germany at 80 % and <wd_idx<1710>> Brazil at 79 % . </P> <P> Additionally , consumers <wd_idx<1720>> receive on average circa 90 emails per day . </P> <wd_idx<1730>> <P> Companies considering the use of an email marketing program <wd_idx<1740>> must make sure that their program does not violate spam <wd_idx<1750>> laws such as the United States ' Controlling the Assault <wd_idx<1760>> of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act ( CAN - SPAM <wd_idx<1770>> ) , the European Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations 2003 <wd_idx<1780>> , or their Internet service provider 's acceptable use policy <wd_idx<1790>> . </P> <H2> Opt - in email advertising </H2> <P> <wd_idx<1800>> Opt - in email advertising , or permission marketing , <wd_idx<1810>> is a method of advertising via email whereby the recipient <wd_idx<1820>> of the advertisement has consented to receive it . This <wd_idx<1830>> method is one of several developed by marketers to eliminate <wd_idx<1840>> the disadvantages of email marketing . </P> <P> Opt - <wd_idx<1850>> in email marketing may evolve into a technology that uses <wd_idx<1860>> a handshake protocol between the sender and receiver . This <wd_idx<1870>> system is intended to eventually result in a high degree <wd_idx<1880>> of satisfaction between consumers and marketers . If opt - <wd_idx<1890>> in email advertising is used , the material that is <wd_idx<1900>> emailed to consumers will be `` anticipated '' . It <wd_idx<1910>> is assumed that the recipient wants to receive it , <wd_idx<1920>> which makes it unlike unsolicited advertisements sent to the consumer <wd_idx<1930>> . Ideally , opt - in email advertisements will be <wd_idx<1940>> more personal and relevant to the consumer than untargeted advertisements <wd_idx<1950>> . </P> <P> A common example of permission marketing is <wd_idx<1960>> a newsletter sent to an advertising firm 's customers . <wd_idx<1970>> Such newsletters inform customers of upcoming events or promotions , <wd_idx<1980>> or new products . In this type of advertising , <wd_idx<1990>> a company that wants to send a newsletter to their <wd_idx<2000>> customers may ask them at the point of purchase if <wd_idx<2010>> they would like to receive the newsletter . </P> <P> <wd_idx<2020>> With a foundation of opted - in contact information stored <wd_idx<2030>> in their database , marketers can send out promotional materials <wd_idx<2040>> automatically using autoresponders -- known as drip marketing . They <wd_idx<2050>> can also segment their promotions to specific market segments . <wd_idx<2060>> </P> <H2> Legal requirements </H2> <H3> Australia </H3> <P> The <wd_idx<2070>> Australian Spam Act 2003 is enforced by the Australian Communications <wd_idx<2080>> and Media Authority , widely known as `` ACMA '' <wd_idx<2090>> . The act defines the term unsolicited electronic messages , <wd_idx<2100>> states how unsubscribe functions must work for commercial messages , <wd_idx<2110>> and gives other key information . Fines range with 3 <wd_idx<2120>> fines of AU $110,000 being issued to Virgin Blue Airlines <wd_idx<2130>> ( 2011 ) , Tiger Airways Holdings Limited ( 2012 <wd_idx<2140>> ) and Cellar master Wines Pty Limited ( 2013 ) <wd_idx<2150>> . </P> <H3> Canada </H3> <P> The `` Canada Anti-Spam <wd_idx\", \"<wd_idx<2120>> fines of AU $110,000 being issued to Virgin Blue Airlines <wd_idx<2130>> ( 2011 ) , Tiger Airways Holdings Limited ( 2012 <wd_idx<2140>> ) and Cellar master Wines Pty Limited ( 2013 ) <wd_idx<2150>> . </P> <H3> Canada </H3> <P> The `` Canada Anti-Spam <wd_idx<2160>> Law '' ( CASL ) went into effect on July <wd_idx<2170>> 1 , 2014 . CASL requires an explicit or implicit <wd_idx<2180>> opt - in from users , and the maximum fines <wd_idx<2190>> for noncompliance are CA $ 1 million for individuals and <wd_idx<2200>> $10 million for businesses . </P> <H3> European Union </H3> <wd_idx<2210>> <P> In 2002 the European Union ( EU ) introduced <wd_idx<2220>> the Directive on Privacy and Electronic Communications . Article 13 <wd_idx<2230>> of the Directive prohibits the use of personal email addresses <wd_idx<2240>> for marketing purposes . The Directive establishes the opt - <wd_idx<2250>> in regime , where unsolicited emails may be sent only <wd_idx<2260>> with prior agreement of the recipient ; this does not <wd_idx<2270>> apply to business email addresses . </P> <P> The directive <wd_idx<2280>> has since been incorporated into the laws of member states <wd_idx<2290>> . In the UK it is covered under the Privacy <wd_idx<2300>> and Electronic Communications ( EC Directive ) Regulations 2003 and <wd_idx<2310>> applies to all organizations that send out marketing by some <wd_idx<2320>> form of electronic communication . </P> <H3> United states </H3> <wd_idx<2330>> <P> The CAN - SPAM Act of 2003 was passed <wd_idx<2340>> by Congress as a direct response of the growing number <wd_idx<2350>> of complaints over spam e-mails . Congress determined that the <wd_idx<2360>> US government was showing an increased interest in the regulation <wd_idx<2370>> of commercial electronic mail nationally , that those who send <wd_idx<2380>> commercial e-mails should not mislead recipients over the source or <wd_idx<2390>> content of them , and that all recipients of such <wd_idx<2400>> emails have a right to decline them . The act <wd_idx<2410>> authorizes a US $16,000 penalty per violation for spamming each <wd_idx<2420>> individual recipient . However , it does not ban spam <wd_idx<2430>> emailing outright , but imposes laws on using deceptive marketing <wd_idx<2440>> methods through headings which are `` materially false or misleading <wd_idx<2450>> '' . In addition there are conditions which email marketers <wd_idx<2460>> must meet in terms of their format , their content <wd_idx<2470>> and labeling . As a result , many commercial email <wd_idx<2480>> marketers within the United States utilize a service or special <wd_idx<2490>> software to ensure compliance with the act . A variety <wd_idx<2500>> of older systems exist that do not ensure compliance with <wd_idx<2510>> the act . To comply with the act 's regulation <wd_idx<2520>> of commercial email , services also typically require users to <wd_idx<2530>> authenticate their return address and include a valid physical address <wd_idx<2540>> , provide a one - click unsubscribe feature , and <wd_idx<2550>> prohibit importing lists of purchased addresses that may not have <wd_idx<2560>> given valid permission . </P> <P> In addition to satisfying <wd_idx<2570>> legal requirements , email service providers ( ESPs ) began <wd_idx<2580>> to help customers establish and manage their own email marketing <wd_idx<2590>> campaigns . The service providers supply email templates and general <wd_idx<2600>> best practices , as well as methods for handling subscriptions <wd_idx<2610>> and cancellations automatically . Some ESPs will provide insight and <wd_\", \"<wd_idx<2570>> legal requirements , email service providers ( ESPs ) began <wd_idx<2580>> to help customers establish and manage their own email marketing <wd_idx<2590>> campaigns .

They <wd_idx<2630>> also provide statistics pertaining to the number of messages received <wd_idx<2640>> and opened , and whether the recipients clicked on any <wd_idx<2650>> links within the messages . </P> <P> The CAN - <wd_idx<2660>> SPAM Act was updated with some new regulations including a <wd_idx<2670>> no - fee provision for opting out , further definition <wd_idx<2680>> of `` sender '' , post office or private mail <wd_idx<2690>> boxes count as a `` valid physical postal address '' <wd_idx<2700>> and definition of `` person '' .

In its broadest sense , every email sent to a potential or current customer could be considered email marketing . It usually involves using email to send advertisements , request business , or solicit sales or donations , and is meant to build loyalty , trust , or brand awareness . Marketing emails can be sent to a purchased lead list or a current customer database . The term usually refers to sending email messages with the purpose of enhancing a merchant 's relationship with current or previous customers , encouraging customer loyalty and repeat business , acquiring new customers or convincing current customers to purchase something immediately , and sharing third - party ads . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 History </Li> <Li> 2 Types <Ul> <Li> 2.1 Transactional emails </Li> <Li> 2.2 Direct emails <Ul> <Li> 2.2. 1 Mobile email marketing </Li> </Ul> </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 3 Comparison to traditional mail <Ul> <Li> 3.1 Advantages </Li> <Li> 3.2 Disadvantages </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 4 Opt - in email advertising </Li> <Li> 5 Legal requirements <Ul> <Li> 5.1 Australia </Li> <Li> 5.2 Canada </Li> <Li> 5.3 European Union </Li> <Li> 5.4 United States </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 6 See also </Li> <Li> 7 References </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> History </H2> <P> Email marketing has evolved rapidly alongside the technological growth of the 21st century . Prior to this growth , when emails were novelties to the majority of customers , email marketing was not as effective . In 1978 , Gary Thuerk of Digital Equipment Corporation ( DEC ) sent out the first mass email to approximately 400 potential clients via the Advanced Research Projects Agency Network ( ARPANET ) . This email resulted in $13 million worth of sales in DEC products , and highlighted the potential of marketing through mass emails . However , as email marketing developed as an effective means of direct communication , users began blocking out content from emails with filters and blocking programs . In order to effectively communicate a message through email , marketers had to develop a way of pushing content through to the end user , without being cut out by automatic filters and spam removing software . This resulted in the birth of triggered marketing emails , which are sent to specific users based on their tracked online browsing patterns . </P> <P> Historically , it has been difficult to measure the effectiveness of marketing campaigns because target markets can not be adequately defined . Email marketing carries the benefit of allowing marketers to identify returns on investment and measure and improve efficiency . Email marketing allows marketers to see feedback from users in real time , and to monitor how effective their campaign is in achieving market penetration , revealing a communication channel 's scope . At the same time , however , it also means that the more personal nature of certain advertising methods , such as television advertisements , can not be captured . </P> <H2> Types </H2> <P> Email marketing can be carried out through different types of emails : </P> <H3> Transactional emails </H3> <P> Transactional emails are usually triggered based on a customer 's action with a company . To be qualified as transactional or relationship messages , these communications ' primary purpose must be `` to facilitate , complete , or confirm a commercial transaction that the recipient has previously agreed to enter into with the sender '' along with a few other narrow definitions of transactional messaging . Triggered transactional messages include dropped basket messages , password reset emails , purchase or order confirmation emails , order status emails , reorder emails , and email receipts . </P> <P> The primary purpose of a transactional email is to convey information regarding the action that triggered it . But , due to their high open rates ( 51.3 % compared to 36.6 % for email newsletters ) , transactional emails are an opportunity to introduce or extend the email relationship with customers or subscribers ; to anticipate and answer questions ; or to cross-sell or up - sell products or services . </P> <P> Many email newsletter software vendors offer transactional email support , which gives companies the ability to include promotional messages within the body of transactional emails . There are also software vendors that offer specialized transactional email marketing services , which include providing targeted and personalized transactional email messages and running specific marketing campaigns ( such as customer referral programs ) . </P> <H3> Direct emails </H3> <P> Direct email involves sending an email solely to communicate a promotional message ( for example , a special offer or a product catalog ) . Companies usually collect a list of customer or prospect email addresses to send direct promotional messages to , or they rent a list of email addresses from service companies . Safe mail marketing is also used . </P> Mobile email marketing <P> Email marketing develops large amounts of traffic through smartphones and tablets . Marketers are researching ways to advertise to more users and to make them view advertising for longer . However , the rate of delivery is still relatively low due to better filtering - out of advertising and users having multiple email accounts for different purposes . Because emails are generated according to the tracked behavior of consumers , it is possible to send advertising which is based on the recipient 's behavior . Because of this , modern email marketing is perceived more often as a pull strategy rather than a push strategy . </P> <H2> Comparison to traditional mail </H2> <P> There are both advantages and disadvantages to using email marketing in comparison to traditional advertising mail . </P> <H3> Advantages </H3> <P> Email marketing is popular with companies for several reasons : </P> <Ul> <Li> An exact return on investment can be tracked ( `` track to basket '' ) and has proven to be high when done properly . Email marketing is often reported as second only to search marketing as the most effective online marketing tactic . </Li> <Li> Email marketing is significantly cheaper and faster than traditional mail , mainly because of the high cost and time required in a traditional mail campaign for producing the artwork , printing , addressing , and mailing . </Li> <Li> Businesses and organizations who send a high volume of emails can use an ESP ( email service provider ) to gather information about the behavior of the recipients . The insights provided by consumer response to email marketing help businesses and organizations understand and make use of consumer behavior . </Li> <Li> Email provides a cost - effective method to test different marketing content , including visual , creative , marketing copy , and multimedia assets . The data gathered by testing in the email channel can then be used across all channels of marketing campaigns , both print and digital . </Li> <Li> Advertisers can reach substantial numbers of email subscribers who have opted in ( i.e. , consented ) to receive the email . </Li> <Li> Almost half of American Internet users check or send email on a typical day , with emails delivered between 1 am and 5 am local time outperforming those sent at other times in open and click rates . </Li> <Li> Email is popular with digital marketers , rising an estimated 15 % in 2009 to £ 292 million in the UK . </Li> <Li> If compared to standard email , direct email marketing produces higher response rate and higher average order value for e-commerce businesses . </Li> </Ul> <H3> Disadvantages </H3> <P> As of mid-2016 email deliverability is still an issue for legitimate marketers . According to the report , legitimate email servers averaged a delivery rate of 73 % in the U.S. ; six percent were filtered as spam , and 22 % were missing . This lags behind other countries : Australia delivers at 90 % , Canada at 89 % , Britain at 88 % , France at 84 % , Germany at 80 % and Brazil at 79 % . </P> <P> Additionally , consumers receive on average circa 90 emails per day . </P> <P> Companies considering the use of an email marketing program must make sure that their program does not violate spam laws such as the United States ' Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act ( CAN - SPAM ) , the European Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations 2003 , or their Internet service provider 's acceptable use policy . </P> <H2> Opt - in email advertising </H2> <P> Opt - in email advertising , or permission marketing , is a method of advertising via email whereby the recipient of the advertisement has consented to receive it . This method is one of several developed by marketers to eliminate the disadvantages of email marketing . </P> <P> Opt - in email marketing may evolve into a technology that uses a handshake protocol between the sender and receiver . This system is intended to eventually result in a high degree of satisfaction between consumers and marketers . If opt - in email advertising is used , the material that is emailed to consumers will be `` anticipated '' . It is assumed that the recipient wants to receive it , which makes it unlike unsolicited advertisements sent to the consumer . Ideally , opt - in email advertisements will be more personal and relevant to the consumer than untargeted advertisements . </P> <P> A common example of permission marketing is a newsletter sent to an advertising firm 's customers . Such newsletters inform customers of upcoming events or promotions , or new products . In this type of advertising , a company that wants to send a newsletter to their customers may ask them at the point of purchase if they would like to receive the newsletter . </P> <P> With a foundation of opted - in contact information stored in their database , marketers can send out promotional materials automatically using autoresponders -- known as drip marketing . They can also segment their promotions to specific market segments . </P> <H2> Legal requirements </H2> <H3> Australia </H3> <P> The Australian Spam Act 2003 is enforced by the Australian Communications and Media Authority , widely known as `` ACMA '' . The act defines the term unsolicited electronic messages , states how unsubscribe functions must work for commercial messages , and gives other key information . Fines range with 3 fines of AU $110,000 being issued to Virgin Blue Airlines ( 2011 ) , Tiger Airways Holdings Limited ( 2012 ) and Cellar master Wines Pty Limited ( 2013 ) . </P> <H3> Canada </H3> <P> The `` Canada Anti-Spam Law '' ( CASL ) went into effect on July 1 , 2014 . CASL requires an explicit or implicit opt - in from users , and the maximum fines for noncompliance are CA $ 1 million for individuals and $10 million for businesses . </P> <H3> European Union </H3> <P> In 2002 the European Union ( EU ) introduced the Directive on Privacy and Electronic Communications . Article 13 of the Directive prohibits the use of personal email addresses for marketing purposes . The Directive establishes the opt - in regime , where unsolicited emails may be sent only with prior agreement of the recipient ; this does not apply to business email addresses . </P> <P> The directive has since been incorporated into the laws of member states . In the UK it is covered under the Privacy and Electronic Communications ( EC Directive ) Regulations 2003 and applies to all organizations that send out marketing by some form of electronic communication . </P> <H3> United states </H3> <P> The CAN - SPAM Act of 2003 was passed by Congress as a direct response of the growing number of complaints over spam e-mails . Congress determined that the US government was showing an increased interest in the regulation of commercial electronic mail nationally , that those who send commercial e-mails should not mislead recipients over the source or content of them , and that all recipients of such emails have a right to decline them . The act authorizes a US $16,000 penalty per violation for spamming each individual recipient . However , it does not ban spam emailing outright , but imposes laws on using deceptive marketing methods through headings which are `` materially false or misleading '' . In addition there are conditions which email marketers must meet in terms of their format , their content and labeling . As a result , many commercial email marketers within the United States utilize a service or special software to ensure compliance with the act . A variety of older systems exist that do not ensure compliance with the act . To comply with the act 's regulation of commercial email , services also typically require users to authenticate their return address and include a valid physical address , provide a one - click unsubscribe feature , and prohibit importing lists of purchased addresses that may not have given valid permission . </P> <P> In addition to satisfying legal requirements , email service providers ( ESPs ) began to help customers establish and manage their own email marketing campaigns . The service providers supply email templates and general best practices , as well as methods for handling subscriptions and cancellations automatically . Some ESPs will provide insight and assistance with deliverability issues for major email providers . They also provide statistics pertaining to the number of messages received and opened , and whether the recipients clicked on any links within the messages . </P> <P> The CAN - SPAM Act was updated with some new regulations including a no - fee provision for opting out , further definition of `` sender '' , post office or private mail boxes count as a `` valid physical postal address '' and definition of `` person '' . These new provisions went into effect on July 7 , 2008 . </P> <H2> See also </H2> <Ul> <Li> CAUCE -- Coalition Against Unsolicited Commercial Email </Li> <Li> Customer engagement </Li> <Li> Suppression list </Li> <Li> Email spam - Unsolicited email marketing </Li> </Ul> <H2> References </H2> <Ol> <Li> Jump up ^ `` spam unsolicited e-mail '' .

Prior to <wd_idx<580>> this growth , when emails were novelties to the majority <wd_idx<590>> of customers , email marketing was not as effective . <wd_idx<600>> In 1978 , Gary Thuerk of Digital Equipment Corporation ( <wd_idx<610>> DEC ) sent out the first mass email to approximately <wd_idx<620>> 400 potential clients via the Advanced Research Projects Agency Network <wd_idx<630>> ( ARPANET ) . This email resulted in $13 million <wd_idx<640>> worth of sales in DEC products , and highlighted the <wd_idx<650>> potential of marketing through mass emails . However , as <wd_idx<660>> email marketing developed as an effective means of direct communication <wd_idx<670>> , users began blocking out content from emails with filters <wd_idx<680>> and blocking programs . In order to effectively communicate a <wd_idx<690>> message through email , marketers had to develop a way <wd_idx<700>> of pushing content through to the end user , without <wd_idx<710>> being cut out by automatic filters and spam removing software <wd_idx<720>> . This resulted in the birth of triggered marketing emails <wd_idx<730>> , which are sent to specific users based on their <wd_idx<740>> tracked online browsing patterns . </P> <P> Historically , it <wd_idx<750>> has been difficult to measure the effectiveness of marketing campaigns <wd_idx<760>> because target markets can not be adequately defined . Email <wd_idx<770>> marketing carries the benefit of allowing marketers to identify returns <wd_idx<780>> on investment and measure and improve efficiency . Email marketing <wd_idx<790>> allows marketers to see feedback from users in real time <wd_idx<800>> , and to monitor how effective their campaign is in <wd_idx<810>> achieving market penetration , revealing a communication channel 's scope <wd_idx<820>> . At\", \"<wd_idx<770>> marketing carries the benefit of allowing marketers to identify returns <wd_idx<780>> on investment and measure and improve efficiency . Email marketing <wd_idx<790>> allows marketers to see feedback from users in real time <wd_idx<800>> , and to monitor how effective their campaign is in <wd_idx<810>> achieving market penetration , revealing a communication channel 's scope <wd_idx<820>> . At the same time , however , it also <wd_idx<830>> means that the more personal nature of certain advertising methods <wd_idx<840>> , such as television advertisements , can not be captured <wd_idx<850>> . </P> <H2> Types </H2> <P> Email marketing can be <wd_idx<860>> carried out through different types of emails : </P> <H3> <wd_idx<870>> Transactional emails </H3> <P> Transactional emails are usually triggered based <wd_idx<880>> on a customer 's action with a company . To <wd_idx<890>> be qualified as transactional or relationship messages , these communications <wd_idx<900>> ' primary purpose must be `` to facilitate , complete <wd_idx<910>> , or confirm a commercial transaction that the recipient has <wd_idx<920>> previously agreed to enter into with the sender '' along <wd_idx<930>> with a few other narrow definitions of transactional messaging . <wd_idx<940>> Triggered transactional messages include dropped basket messages , password reset <wd_idx<950>> emails , purchase or order confirmation emails , order status <wd_idx<960>> emails , reorder emails , and email receipts . </P> <wd_idx<970>> <P> The primary purpose of a transactional email is to <wd_idx<980>> convey information regarding the action that triggered it . But <wd_idx<990>> , due to their high open rates ( 51.3 % <wd_idx<1000>> compared to 36.6 % for email newsletters ) , transactional <wd_idx<1010>> emails are an opportunity to introduce or extend the email <wd_idx<1020>> relationship with customers or subscribers ; to anticipate and answer <wd_idx<1030>> questions ; or to cross-sell or up - sell products <wd_idx<1040>> or services . </P> <P> Many email newsletter software vendors <wd_idx<1050>> offer transactional email support , which gives companies the ability <wd_idx<1060>> to include promotional messages within the body of transactional emails <wd_idx<1070>> . There are also software vendors that offer specialized transactional <wd_idx<1080>> email marketing services , which include providing targeted and personalized <wd_idx<1090>> transactional email messages and running specific marketing campaigns ( such <wd_idx<1100>> as customer referral programs ) . </P> <H3> Direct emails <wd_idx<1110>> </H3> <P> Direct email involves sending an email solely to <wd_idx<1120>> communicate a promotional message ( for example , a special <wd_idx<1130>> offer or a product catalog ) . Companies usually collect <wd_idx<1140>> a list of customer or prospect email addresses to send <wd_idx<1150>> direct promotional messages to , or they rent a list <wd_idx<1160>> of email addresses from service companies . Safe mail marketing <wd_idx<1170>> is also used . </P> Mobile email marketing <P> Email <wd_idx<1180>> marketing develops large amounts of traffic through smartphones and tablets <wd_idx<1190>> . Marketers are researching ways to advertise to more users <wd_idx<1200>> and to make them view advertising for longer . However <wd_idx<1210>> , the rate of delivery is still relatively low due <wd_idx<1220>> to better filtering - out of advertising and users having <wd_idx<1230>> multiple email accounts for different purposes . Because emails are <wd_idx<1240>> generated according to the tracked behavior of consumers , it <wd_idx<1250>> is possible to send advertising which is based on the <wd_idx<1260>> recipient 's behavior . Because of this , modern email <wd_idx<1270>> marketing is perceived more often as a pull strategy rather <wd_idx\", \"<wd_idx<1230>> multiple email accounts for different purposes .

Because of this , modern email <wd_idx<1270>> marketing is perceived more often as a pull strategy rather <wd_idx<1280>> than a push strategy . </P> <H2> Comparison to traditional <wd_idx<1290>> mail </H2> <P> There are both advantages and disadvantages to <wd_idx<1300>> using email marketing in comparison to traditional advertising mail . <wd_idx<1310>> </P> <H3> Advantages </H3> <P> Email marketing is popular with <wd_idx<1320>> companies for several reasons : </P> <Ul> <Li> An exact <wd_idx<1330>> return on investment can be tracked ( `` track to <wd_idx<1340>> basket '' ) and has proven to be high when <wd_idx<1350>> done properly . Email marketing is often reported as second <wd_idx<1360>> only to search marketing as the most effective online marketing <wd_idx<1370>> tactic . </Li> <Li> Email marketing is significantly cheaper and <wd_idx<1380>> faster than traditional mail , mainly because of the high <wd_idx<1390>> cost and time required in a traditional mail campaign for <wd_idx<1400>> producing the artwork , printing , addressing , and mailing <wd_idx<1410>> . </Li> <Li> Businesses and organizations who send a high <wd_idx<1420>> volume of emails can use an ESP ( email service <wd_idx<1430>> provider ) to gather information about the behavior of the <wd_idx<1440>> recipients . The insights provided by consumer response to email <wd_idx<1450>> marketing help businesses and organizations understand and make use of <wd_idx<1460>> consumer behavior . </Li> <Li> Email provides a cost - <wd_idx<1470>> effective method to test different marketing content , including visual <wd_idx<1480>> , creative , marketing copy , and multimedia assets . <wd_idx<1490>> The data gathered by testing in the email channel can <wd_idx<1500>> then be used across all channels of marketing campaigns , <wd_idx<1510>> both print and digital . </Li> <Li> Advertisers can reach <wd_idx<1520>> substantial numbers of email subscribers who have opted in ( <wd_idx<1530>> i.e. , consented ) to receive the email . </Li> <wd_idx<1540>> <Li> Almost half of American Internet users check or send <wd_idx<1550>> email on a typical day , with emails delivered between <wd_idx<1560>> 1 am and 5 am local time outperforming those sent <wd_idx<1570>> at other times in open and click rates . </Li> <wd_idx<1580>> <Li> Email is popular with digital marketers , rising an <wd_idx<1590>> estimated 15 % in 2009 to £ 292 million in <wd_idx<1600>> the UK . </Li> <Li> If compared to standard email <wd_idx<1610>> , direct email marketing produces higher response rate and higher <wd_idx<1620>> average order value for e-commerce businesses . </Li> </Ul> <H3> <wd_idx<1630>> Disadvantages </H3> <P> As of mid-2016 email deliverability is still <wd_idx<1640>> an issue for legitimate marketers . According to the report <wd_idx<1650>> , legitimate email servers averaged a delivery rate of 73 <wd_idx<1660>> % in the U.S. ; six percent were filtered as <wd_idx<1670>> spam , and 22 % were missing . This lags <wd_idx<1680>> behind other countries : Australia delivers at 90 % , <wd_idx<1690>> Canada at 89 % , Britain at 88 % , <wd_idx<1700>> France at 84 % , Germany at 80 % and <wd_idx<1710>> Brazil at 79 % . </P> <P> Additionally , consumers \", \"<wd_idx<1670>> spam , and 22 % were missing . This lags <wd_idx<1680>> behind other countries : Australia delivers at 90 % , <wd_idx<1690>> Canada at 89 % , Britain at 88 % , <wd_idx<1700>> France at 84 % , Germany at 80 % and <wd_idx<1710>> Brazil at 79 % . </P> <P> Additionally , consumers <wd_idx<1720>> receive on average circa 90 emails per day . </P> <wd_idx<1730>> <P> Companies considering the use of an email marketing program <wd_idx<1740>> must make sure that their program does not violate spam <wd_idx<1750>> laws such as the United States ' Controlling the Assault <wd_idx<1760>> of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act ( CAN - SPAM <wd_idx<1770>> ) , the European Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations 2003 <wd_idx<1780>> , or their Internet service provider 's acceptable use policy <wd_idx<1790>> . </P> <H2> Opt - in email advertising </H2> <P> <wd_idx<1800>> Opt - in email advertising , or permission marketing , <wd_idx<1810>> is a method of advertising via email whereby the recipient <wd_idx<1820>> of the advertisement has consented to receive it . This <wd_idx<1830>> method is one of several developed by marketers to eliminate <wd_idx<1840>> the disadvantages of email marketing . </P> <P> Opt - <wd_idx<1850>> in email marketing may evolve into a technology that uses <wd_idx<1860>> a handshake protocol between the sender and receiver . This <wd_idx<1870>> system is intended to eventually result in a high degree <wd_idx<1880>> of satisfaction between consumers and marketers . If opt - <wd_idx<1890>> in email advertising is used , the material that is <wd_idx<1900>> emailed to consumers will be `` anticipated '' . It <wd_idx<1910>> is assumed that the recipient wants to receive it , <wd_idx<1920>> which makes it unlike unsolicited advertisements sent to the consumer <wd_idx<1930>> . Ideally , opt - in email advertisements will be <wd_idx<1940>> more personal and relevant to the consumer than untargeted advertisements <wd_idx<1950>> . </P> <P> A common example of permission marketing is <wd_idx<1960>> a newsletter sent to an advertising firm 's customers . <wd_idx<1970>> Such newsletters inform customers of upcoming events or promotions , <wd_idx<1980>> or new products . In this type of advertising , <wd_idx<1990>> a company that wants to send a newsletter to their <wd_idx<2000>> customers may ask them at the point of purchase if <wd_idx<2010>> they would like to receive the newsletter . </P> <P> <wd_idx<2020>> With a foundation of opted - in contact information stored <wd_idx<2030>> in their database , marketers can send out promotional materials <wd_idx<2040>> automatically using autoresponders -- known as drip marketing . They <wd_idx<2050>> can also segment their promotions to specific market segments . <wd_idx<2060>> </P> <H2> Legal requirements </H2> <H3> Australia </H3> <P> The <wd_idx<2070>> Australian Spam Act 2003 is enforced by the Australian Communications <wd_idx<2080>> and Media Authority , widely known as `` ACMA '' <wd_idx<2090>> . The act defines the term unsolicited electronic messages , <wd_idx<2100>> states how unsubscribe functions must work for commercial messages , <wd_idx<2110>> and gives other key information . Fines range with 3 <wd_idx<2120>> fines of AU $110,000 being issued to Virgin Blue Airlines <wd_idx<2130>> ( 2011 ) , Tiger Airways Holdings Limited ( 2012 <wd_idx<2140>> ) and Cellar master Wines Pty Limited ( 2013 ) <wd_idx<2150>> . </P> <H3> Canada </H3> <P> The `` Canada Anti-Spam <wd_idx\", \"<wd_idx<2120>> fines of AU $110,000 being issued to Virgin Blue Airlines <wd_idx<2130>> ( 2011 ) , Tiger Airways Holdings Limited ( 2012 <wd_idx<2140>> ) and Cellar master Wines Pty Limited ( 2013 ) <wd_idx<2150>> . </P> <H3> Canada </H3> <P> The `` Canada Anti-Spam <wd_idx<2160>> Law '' ( CASL ) went into effect on July <wd_idx<2170>> 1 , 2014 . CASL requires an explicit or implicit <wd_idx<2180>> opt - in from users , and the maximum fines <wd_idx<2190>> for noncompliance are CA $ 1 million for individuals and <wd_idx<2200>> $10 million for businesses . </P> <H3> European Union </H3> <wd_idx<2210>> <P> In 2002 the European Union ( EU ) introduced <wd_idx<2220>> the Directive on Privacy and Electronic Communications . Article 13 <wd_idx<2230>> of the Directive prohibits the use of personal email addresses <wd_idx<2240>> for marketing purposes . The Directive establishes the opt - <wd_idx<2250>> in regime , where unsolicited emails may be sent only <wd_idx<2260>> with prior agreement of the recipient ; this does not <wd_idx<2270>> apply to business email addresses . </P> <P> The directive <wd_idx<2280>> has since been incorporated into the laws of member states <wd_idx<2290>> . In the UK it is covered under the Privacy <wd_idx<2300>> and Electronic Communications ( EC Directive ) Regulations 2003 and <wd_idx<2310>> applies to all organizations that send out marketing by some <wd_idx<2320>> form of electronic communication . </P> <H3> United states </H3> <wd_idx<2330>> <P> The CAN - SPAM Act of 2003 was passed <wd_idx<2340>> by Congress as a direct response of the growing number <wd_idx<2350>> of complaints over spam e-mails . Congress determined that the <wd_idx<2360>> US government was showing an increased interest in the regulation <wd_idx<2370>> of commercial electronic mail nationally , that those who send <wd_idx<2380>> commercial e-mails should not mislead recipients over the source or <wd_idx<2390>> content of them , and that all recipients of such <wd_idx<2400>> emails have a right to decline them . The act <wd_idx<2410>> authorizes a US $16,000 penalty per violation for spamming each <wd_idx<2420>> individual recipient . However , it does not ban spam <wd_idx<2430>> emailing outright , but imposes laws on using deceptive marketing <wd_idx<2440>> methods through headings which are `` materially false or misleading <wd_idx<2450>> '' . In addition there are conditions which email marketers <wd_idx<2460>> must meet in terms of their format , their content <wd_idx<2470>> and labeling . As a result , many commercial email <wd_idx<2480>> marketers within the United States utilize a service or special <wd_idx<2490>> software to ensure compliance with the act . A variety <wd_idx<2500>> of older systems exist that do not ensure compliance with <wd_idx<2510>> the act . To comply with the act 's regulation <wd_idx<2520>> of commercial email , services also typically require users to <wd_idx<2530>> authenticate their return address and include a valid physical address <wd_idx<2540>> , provide a one - click unsubscribe feature , and <wd_idx<2550>> prohibit importing lists of purchased addresses that may not have <wd_idx<2560>> given valid permission . </P> <P> In addition to satisfying <wd_idx<2570>> legal requirements , email service providers ( ESPs ) began <wd_idx<2580>> to help customers establish and manage their own email marketing <wd_idx<2590>> campaigns . The service providers supply email templates and general <wd_idx<2600>> best practices , as well as methods for handling subscriptions <wd_idx<2610>> and cancellations automatically .

In its broadest sense , every email sent to a potential or current customer could be considered email marketing . It usually involves using email to send advertisements , request business , or solicit sales or donations , and is meant to build loyalty , trust , or brand awareness . Marketing emails can be sent to a purchased lead list or a current customer database . The term usually refers to sending email messages with the purpose of enhancing a merchant 's relationship with current or previous customers , encouraging customer loyalty and repeat business , acquiring new customers or convincing current customers to purchase something immediately , and sharing third - party ads . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 History </Li> <Li> 2 Types <Ul> <Li> 2.1 Transactional emails </Li> <Li> 2.2 Direct emails <Ul> <Li> 2.2. 1 Mobile email marketing </Li> </Ul> </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 3 Comparison to traditional mail <Ul> <Li> 3.1 Advantages </Li> <Li> 3.2 Disadvantages </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 4 Opt - in email advertising </Li> <Li> 5 Legal requirements <Ul> <Li> 5.1 Australia </Li> <Li> 5.2 Canada </Li> <Li> 5.3 European Union </Li> <Li> 5.4 United States </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 6 See also </Li> <Li> 7 References </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> History </H2> <P> Email marketing has evolved rapidly alongside the technological growth of the 21st century . Prior to this growth , when emails were novelties to the majority of customers , email marketing was not as effective . In 1978 , Gary Thuerk of Digital Equipment Corporation ( DEC ) sent out the first mass email to approximately 400 potential clients via the Advanced Research Projects Agency Network ( ARPANET ) . This email resulted in $13 million worth of sales in DEC products , and highlighted the potential of marketing through mass emails . However , as email marketing developed as an effective means of direct communication , users began blocking out content from emails with filters and blocking programs . In order to effectively communicate a message through email , marketers had to develop a way of pushing content through to the end user , without being cut out by automatic filters and spam removing software . This resulted in the birth of triggered marketing emails , which are sent to specific users based on their tracked online browsing patterns . </P> <P> Historically , it has been difficult to measure the effectiveness of marketing campaigns because target markets can not be adequately defined . Email marketing carries the benefit of allowing marketers to identify returns on investment and measure and improve efficiency . Email marketing allows marketers to see feedback from users in real time , and to monitor how effective their campaign is in achieving market penetration , revealing a communication channel 's scope . At the same time , however , it also means that the more personal nature of certain advertising methods , such as television advertisements , can not be captured . </P> <H2> Types </H2> <P> Email marketing can be carried out through different types of emails : </P> <H3> Transactional emails </H3> <P> Transactional emails are usually triggered based on a customer 's action with a company . To be qualified as transactional or relationship messages , these communications ' primary purpose must be `` to facilitate , complete , or confirm a commercial transaction that the recipient has previously agreed to enter into with the sender '' along with a few other narrow definitions of transactional messaging . Triggered transactional messages include dropped basket messages , password reset emails , purchase or order confirmation emails , order status emails , reorder emails , and email receipts . </P> <P> The primary purpose of a transactional email is to convey information regarding the action that triggered it . But , due to their high open rates ( 51.3 % compared to 36.6 % for email newsletters ) , transactional emails are an opportunity to introduce or extend the email relationship with customers or subscribers ; to anticipate and answer questions ; or to cross-sell or up - sell products or services . </P> <P> Many email newsletter software vendors offer transactional email support , which gives companies the ability to include promotional messages within the body of transactional emails . There are also software vendors that offer specialized transactional email marketing services , which include providing targeted and personalized transactional email messages and running specific marketing campaigns ( such as customer referral programs ) . </P> <H3> Direct emails </H3> <P> Direct email involves sending an email solely to communicate a promotional message ( for example , a special offer or a product catalog ) . Companies usually collect a list of customer or prospect email addresses to send direct promotional messages to , or they rent a list of email addresses from service companies . Safe mail marketing is also used . </P> Mobile email marketing <P> Email marketing develops large amounts of traffic through smartphones and tablets . Marketers are researching ways to advertise to more users and to make them view advertising for longer . However , the rate of delivery is still relatively low due to better filtering - out of advertising and users having multiple email accounts for different purposes . Because emails are generated according to the tracked behavior of consumers , it is possible to send advertising which is based on the recipient 's behavior . Because of this , modern email marketing is perceived more often as a pull strategy rather than a push strategy . </P> <H2> Comparison to traditional mail </H2> <P> There are both advantages and disadvantages to using email marketing in comparison to traditional advertising mail . </P> <H3> Advantages </H3> <P> Email marketing is popular with companies for several reasons : </P> <Ul> <Li> An exact return on investment can be tracked ( `` track to basket '' ) and has proven to be high when done properly . Email marketing is often reported as second only to search marketing as the most effective online marketing tactic . </Li> <Li> Email marketing is significantly cheaper and faster than traditional mail , mainly because of the high cost and time required in a traditional mail campaign for producing the artwork , printing , addressing , and mailing . </Li> <Li> Businesses and organizations who send a high volume of emails can use an ESP ( email service provider ) to gather information about the behavior of the recipients . The insights provided by consumer response to email marketing help businesses and organizations understand and make use of consumer behavior . </Li> <Li> Email provides a cost - effective method to test different marketing content , including visual , creative , marketing copy , and multimedia assets . The data gathered by testing in the email channel can then be used across all channels of marketing campaigns , both print and digital . </Li> <Li> Advertisers can reach substantial numbers of email subscribers who have opted in ( i.e. , consented ) to receive the email . </Li> <Li> Almost half of American Internet users check or send email on a typical day , with emails delivered between 1 am and 5 am local time outperforming those sent at other times in open and click rates . </Li> <Li> Email is popular with digital marketers , rising an estimated 15 % in 2009 to £ 292 million in the UK . </Li> <Li> If compared to standard email , direct email marketing produces higher response rate and higher average order value for e-commerce businesses . </Li> </Ul> <H3> Disadvantages </H3> <P> As of mid-2016 email deliverability is still an issue for legitimate marketers . According to the report , legitimate email servers averaged a delivery rate of 73 % in the U.S. ; six percent were filtered as spam , and 22 % were missing . This lags behind other countries : Australia delivers at 90 % , Canada at 89 % , Britain at 88 % , France at 84 % , Germany at 80 % and Brazil at 79 % . </P> <P> Additionally , consumers receive on average circa 90 emails per day . </P> <P> Companies considering the use of an email marketing program must make sure that their program does not violate spam laws such as the United States ' Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act ( CAN - SPAM ) , the European Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations 2003 , or their Internet service provider 's acceptable use policy . </P> <H2> Opt - in email advertising </H2> <P> Opt - in email advertising , or permission marketing , is a method of advertising via email whereby the recipient of the advertisement has consented to receive it . This method is one of several developed by marketers to eliminate the disadvantages of email marketing . </P> <P> Opt - in email marketing may evolve into a technology that uses a handshake protocol between the sender and receiver . This system is intended to eventually result in a high degree of satisfaction between consumers and marketers . If opt - in email advertising is used , the material that is emailed to consumers will be `` anticipated '' . It is assumed that the recipient wants to receive it , which makes it unlike unsolicited advertisements sent to the consumer . Ideally , opt - in email advertisements will be more personal and relevant to the consumer than untargeted advertisements . </P> <P> A common example of permission marketing is a newsletter sent to an advertising firm 's customers . Such newsletters inform customers of upcoming events or promotions , or new products . In this type of advertising , a company that wants to send a newsletter to their customers may ask them at the point of purchase if they would like to receive the newsletter . </P> <P> With a foundation of opted - in contact information stored in their database , marketers can send out promotional materials automatically using autoresponders -- known as drip marketing . They can also segment their promotions to specific market segments . </P> <H2> Legal requirements </H2> <H3> Australia </H3> <P> The Australian Spam Act 2003 is enforced by the Australian Communications and Media Authority , widely known as `` ACMA '' . The act defines the term unsolicited electronic messages , states how unsubscribe functions must work for commercial messages , and gives other key information . Fines range with 3 fines of AU $110,000 being issued to Virgin Blue Airlines ( 2011 ) , Tiger Airways Holdings Limited ( 2012 ) and Cellar master Wines Pty Limited ( 2013 ) . </P> <H3> Canada </H3> <P> The `` Canada Anti-Spam Law '' ( CASL ) went into effect on July 1 , 2014 . CASL requires an explicit or implicit opt - in from users , and the maximum fines for noncompliance are CA $ 1 million for individuals and $10 million for businesses . </P> <H3> European Union </H3> <P> In 2002 the European Union ( EU ) introduced the Directive on Privacy and Electronic Communications . Article 13 of the Directive prohibits the use of personal email addresses for marketing purposes . The Directive establishes the opt - in regime , where unsolicited emails may be sent only with prior agreement of the recipient ; this does not apply to business email addresses . </P> <P> The directive has since been incorporated into the laws of member states . In the UK it is covered under the Privacy and Electronic Communications ( EC Directive ) Regulations 2003 and applies to all organizations that send out marketing by some form of electronic communication . </P> <H3> United states </H3> <P> The CAN - SPAM Act of 2003 was passed by Congress as a direct response of the growing number of complaints over spam e-mails . Congress determined that the US government was showing an increased interest in the regulation of commercial electronic mail nationally , that those who send commercial e-mails should not mislead recipients over the source or content of them , and that all recipients of such emails have a right to decline them . The act authorizes a US $16,000 penalty per violation for spamming each individual recipient . However , it does not ban spam emailing outright , but imposes laws on using deceptive marketing methods through headings which are `` materially false or misleading '' . In addition there are conditions which email marketers must meet in terms of their format , their content and labeling . As a result , many commercial email marketers within the United States utilize a service or special software to ensure compliance with the act . A variety of older systems exist that do not ensure compliance with the act . To comply with the act 's regulation of commercial email , services also typically require users to authenticate their return address and include a valid physical address , provide a one - click unsubscribe feature , and prohibit importing lists of purchased addresses that may not have given valid permission . </P> <P> In addition to satisfying legal requirements , email service providers ( ESPs ) began to help customers establish and manage their own email marketing campaigns . The service providers supply email templates and general best practices , as well as methods for handling subscriptions and cancellations automatically . Some ESPs will provide insight and assistance with deliverability issues for major email providers . They also provide statistics pertaining to the number of messages received and opened , and whether the recipients clicked on any links within the messages . </P> <P> The CAN - SPAM Act was updated with some new regulations including a no - fee provision for opting out , further definition of `` sender '' , post office or private mail boxes count as a `` valid physical postal address '' and definition of `` person '' . These new provisions went into effect on July 7 , 2008 . </P> <H2> See also </H2> <Ul> <Li> CAUCE -- Coalition Against Unsolicited Commercial Email </Li> <Li> Customer engagement </Li> <Li> Suppression list </Li> <Li> Email spam - Unsolicited email marketing </Li> </Ul> <H2> References </H2> <Ol> <Li> Jump up ^ `` spam unsolicited e-mail '' .

In its broadest sense , every email <wd_idx<350>> sent to a potential or current customer could be considered <wd_idx<360>> email marketing . It usually involves using email to send <wd_idx<370>> advertisements , request business , or solicit sales or donations <wd_idx<380>> , and is meant to build loyalty , trust , <wd_idx<390>> or brand awareness . Marketing emails can be sent to <wd_idx<400>> a purchased lead', \"<wd_idx<350>> sent to a potential or current customer could be considered <wd_idx<360>> email marketing .

Marketing emails can be sent to <wd_idx<400>> a purchased lead list or a current customer database . <wd_idx<410>> The term usually refers to sending email messages with the <wd_idx<420>> purpose of enhancing a merchant 's relationship with current or <wd_idx<430>> previous customers , encouraging customer loyalty and repeat business , <wd_idx<440>> acquiring new customers or convincing current customers to purchase something <wd_idx<450>> immediately , and sharing third - party ads . </P> <wd_idx<460>> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> <wd_idx<470>> 1 History </Li> <Li> 2 Types <Ul> <Li> 2.1 Transactional <wd_idx<480>> emails </Li> <Li> 2.2 Direct emails <Ul> <Li> 2.2. 1 <wd_idx<490>> Mobile email marketing </Li> </Ul> </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 3 <wd_idx<500>> Comparison to traditional mail <Ul> <Li> 3.1 Advantages </Li> <Li> <wd_idx<510>> 3.2 Disadvantages </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 4 Opt - in <wd_idx<520>> email advertising </Li> <Li> 5 Legal requirements <Ul> <Li> 5.1 <wd_idx<530>> Australia </Li> <Li> 5.2 Canada </Li> <Li> 5.3 European Union <wd_idx<540>> </Li> <Li> 5.4 United States </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 6 <wd_idx<550>> See also </Li> <Li> 7 References </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <wd_idx<560>> <H2> History </H2> <P> Email marketing has evolved rapidly alongside <wd_idx<570>> the technological growth of the 21st century . Prior to <wd_idx<580>> this growth , when emails were novelties to the majority <wd_idx<590>> of customers , email marketing was not as effective . <wd_idx<600>> In 1978 , Gary Thuerk of Digital Equipment Corporation ( <wd_idx<610>> DEC ) sent out the first mass email to approximately <wd_idx<620>> 400 potential clients via the Advanced Research Projects Agency Network <wd_idx<630>> ( ARPANET ) . This email resulted in $13 million <wd_idx<640>> worth of sales in DEC products , and highlighted the <wd_idx<650>> potential of marketing through mass emails . However , as <wd_idx<660>> email marketing developed as an effective means of direct communication <wd_idx<670>> , users began blocking out content from emails with filters <wd_idx<680>> and blocking programs . In order to effectively communicate a <wd_idx<690>> message through email , marketers had to develop a way <wd_idx<700>> of pushing content through to the end user , without <wd_idx<710>> being cut out by automatic filters and spam removing software <wd_idx<720>> . This resulted in the birth of triggered marketing emails <wd_idx<730>> , which are sent to specific users based on their <wd_idx<740>> tracked online browsing patterns . </P> <P> Historically , it <wd_idx<750>> has been difficult to measure the effectiveness of marketing campaigns <wd_idx<760>> because target markets can not be adequately defined . Email <wd_idx<770>> marketing carries the benefit of allowing marketers to identify returns <wd_idx<780>> on investment and measure and improve efficiency . Email marketing <wd_idx<790>> allows marketers to see feedback from users in real time <wd_idx<800>> , and to monitor how effective their campaign is in <wd_idx<810>> achieving market penetration , revealing a communication channel 's scope <wd_idx<820>> . At\", \"<wd_idx<770>> marketing carries the benefit of allowing marketers to identify returns <wd_idx<780>> on investment and measure and improve efficiency . Email marketing <wd_idx<790>> allows marketers to see feedback from users in real time <wd_idx<800>> , and to monitor how effective their campaign is in <wd_idx<810>> achieving market penetration , revealing a communication channel 's scope <wd_idx<820>> . At the same time , however , it also <wd_idx<830>> means that the more personal nature of certain advertising methods <wd_idx<840>> , such as television advertisements , can not be captured <wd_idx<850>> . </P> <H2> Types </H2> <P> Email marketing can be <wd_idx<860>> carried out through different types of emails : </P> <H3> <wd_idx<870>> Transactional emails </H3> <P> Transactional emails are usually triggered based <wd_idx<880>> on a customer 's action with a company . To <wd_idx<890>> be qualified as transactional or relationship messages , these communications <wd_idx<900>> ' primary purpose must be `` to facilitate , complete <wd_idx<910>> , or confirm a commercial transaction that the recipient has <wd_idx<920>> previously agreed to enter into with the sender '' along <wd_idx<930>> with a few other narrow definitions of transactional messaging . <wd_idx<940>> Triggered transactional messages include dropped basket messages , password reset <wd_idx<950>> emails , purchase or order confirmation emails , order status <wd_idx<960>> emails , reorder emails , and email receipts . </P> <wd_idx<970>> <P> The primary purpose of a transactional email is to <wd_idx<980>> convey information regarding the action that triggered it . But <wd_idx<990>> , due to their high open rates ( 51.3 % <wd_idx<1000>> compared to 36.6 % for email newsletters ) , transactional <wd_idx<1010>> emails are an opportunity to introduce or extend the email <wd_idx<1020>> relationship with customers or subscribers ; to anticipate and answer <wd_idx<1030>> questions ; or to cross-sell or up - sell products <wd_idx<1040>> or services . </P> <P> Many email newsletter software vendors <wd_idx<1050>> offer transactional email support , which gives companies the ability <wd_idx<1060>> to include promotional messages within the body of transactional emails <wd_idx<1070>> . There are also software vendors that offer specialized transactional <wd_idx<1080>> email marketing services , which include providing targeted and personalized <wd_idx<1090>> transactional email messages and running specific marketing campaigns ( such <wd_idx<1100>> as customer referral programs ) . </P> <H3> Direct emails <wd_idx<1110>> </H3> <P> Direct email involves sending an email solely to <wd_idx<1120>> communicate a promotional message ( for example , a special <wd_idx<1130>> offer or a product catalog ) . Companies usually collect <wd_idx<1140>> a list of customer or prospect email addresses to send <wd_idx<1150>> direct promotional messages to , or they rent a list <wd_idx<1160>> of email addresses from service companies . Safe mail marketing <wd_idx<1170>> is also used . </P> Mobile email marketing <P> Email <wd_idx<1180>> marketing develops large amounts of traffic through smartphones and tablets <wd_idx<1190>> . Marketers are researching ways to advertise to more users <wd_idx<1200>> and to make them view advertising for longer . However <wd_idx<1210>> , the rate of delivery is still relatively low due <wd_idx<1220>> to better filtering - out of advertising and users having <wd_idx<1230>> multiple email accounts for different purposes . Because emails are <wd_idx<1240>> generated according to the tracked behavior of consumers , it <wd_idx<1250>> is possible to send advertising which is based on the <wd_idx<1260>> recipient 's behavior . Because of this , modern email <wd_idx<1270>> marketing is perceived more often as a pull strategy rather <wd_idx\", \"<wd_idx<1230>> multiple email accounts for different purposes . Because emails are <wd_idx<1240>> generated according to the tracked behavior of consumers , it <wd_idx<1250>> is possible to send advertising which is based on the <wd_idx<1260>> recipient 's behavior . Because of this , modern email <wd_idx<1270>> marketing is perceived more often as a pull strategy rather <wd_idx<1280>> than a push strategy . </P> <H2> Comparison to traditional <wd_idx<1290>> mail </H2> <P> There are both advantages and disadvantages to <wd_idx<1300>> using email marketing in comparison to traditional advertising mail . <wd_idx<1310>> </P> <H3> Advantages </H3> <P> Email marketing is popular with <wd_idx<1320>> companies for several reasons : </P> <Ul> <Li> An exact <wd_idx<1330>> return on investment can be tracked ( `` track to <wd_idx<1340>> basket '' ) and has proven to be high when <wd_idx<1350>> done properly . Email marketing is often reported as second <wd_idx<1360>> only to search marketing as the most effective online marketing <wd_idx<1370>> tactic . </Li> <Li> Email marketing is significantly cheaper and <wd_idx<1380>> faster than traditional mail , mainly because of the high <wd_idx<1390>> cost and time required in a traditional mail campaign for <wd_idx<1400>> producing the artwork , printing , addressing , and mailing <wd_idx<1410>> . </Li> <Li> Businesses and organizations who send a high <wd_idx<1420>> volume of emails can use an ESP ( email service <wd_idx<1430>> provider ) to gather information about the behavior of the <wd_idx<1440>> recipients . The insights provided by consumer response to email <wd_idx<1450>> marketing help businesses and organizations understand and make use of <wd_idx<1460>> consumer behavior . </Li> <Li> Email provides a cost - <wd_idx<1470>> effective method to test different marketing content , including visual <wd_idx<1480>> , creative , marketing copy , and multimedia assets . <wd_idx<1490>> The data gathered by testing in the email channel can <wd_idx<1500>> then be used across all channels of marketing campaigns , <wd_idx<1510>> both print and digital . </Li> <Li> Advertisers can reach <wd_idx<1520>> substantial numbers of email subscribers who have opted in ( <wd_idx<1530>> i.e. , consented ) to receive the email . </Li> <wd_idx<1540>> <Li> Almost half of American Internet users check or send <wd_idx<1550>> email on a typical day , with emails delivered between <wd_idx<1560>> 1 am and 5 am local time outperforming those sent <wd_idx<1570>> at other times in open and click rates . </Li> <wd_idx<1580>> <Li> Email is popular with digital marketers , rising an <wd_idx<1590>> estimated 15 % in 2009 to £ 292 million in <wd_idx<1600>> the UK . </Li> <Li> If compared to standard email <wd_idx<1610>> , direct email marketing produces higher response rate and higher <wd_idx<1620>> average order value for e-commerce businesses . </Li> </Ul> <H3> <wd_idx<1630>> Disadvantages </H3> <P> As of mid-2016 email deliverability is still <wd_idx<1640>> an issue for legitimate marketers . According to the report <wd_idx<1650>> , legitimate email servers averaged a delivery rate of 73 <wd_idx<1660>> % in the U.S. ; six percent were filtered as <wd_idx<1670>> spam , and 22 % were missing . This lags <wd_idx<1680>> behind other countries : Australia delivers at 90 % , <wd_idx<1690>> Canada at 89 % , Britain at 88 % , <wd_idx<1700>> France at 84 % , Germany at 80 % and <wd_idx<1710>> Brazil at 79 % . </P> <P> Additionally , consumers \", \"<wd_idx<1670>> spam , and 22 % were missing . This lags <wd_idx<1680>> behind other countries : Australia delivers at 90 % , <wd_idx<1690>> Canada at 89 % , Britain at 88 % , <wd_idx<1700>> France at 84 % , Germany at 80 % and <wd_idx<1710>> Brazil at 79 % . </P> <P> Additionally , consumers <wd_idx<1720>> receive on average circa 90 emails per day . </P> <wd_idx<1730>> <P> Companies considering the use of an email marketing program <wd_idx<1740>> must make sure that their program does not violate spam <wd_idx<1750>> laws such as the United States ' Controlling the Assault <wd_idx<1760>> of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act ( CAN - SPAM <wd_idx<1770>> ) , the European Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations 2003 <wd_idx<1780>> , or their Internet service provider 's acceptable use policy <wd_idx<1790>> . </P> <H2> Opt - in email advertising </H2> <P> <wd_idx<1800>> Opt - in email advertising , or permission marketing , <wd_idx<1810>> is a method of advertising via email whereby the recipient <wd_idx<1820>> of the advertisement has consented to receive it . This <wd_idx<1830>> method is one of several developed by marketers to eliminate <wd_idx<1840>> the disadvantages of email marketing . </P> <P> Opt - <wd_idx<1850>> in email marketing may evolve into a technology that uses <wd_idx<1860>> a handshake protocol between the sender and receiver . This <wd_idx<1870>> system is intended to eventually result in a high degree <wd_idx<1880>> of satisfaction between consumers and marketers . If opt - <wd_idx<1890>> in email advertising is used , the material that is <wd_idx<1900>> emailed to consumers will be `` anticipated '' . It <wd_idx<1910>> is assumed that the recipient wants to receive it , <wd_idx<1920>> which makes it unlike unsolicited advertisements sent to the consumer <wd_idx<1930>> . Ideally , opt - in email advertisements will be <wd_idx<1940>> more personal and relevant to the consumer than untargeted advertisements <wd_idx<1950>> . </P> <P> A common example of permission marketing is <wd_idx<1960>> a newsletter sent to an advertising firm 's customers . <wd_idx<1970>> Such newsletters inform customers of upcoming events or promotions , <wd_idx<1980>> or new products . In this type of advertising , <wd_idx<1990>> a company that wants to send a newsletter to their <wd_idx<2000>> customers may ask them at the point of purchase if <wd_idx<2010>> they would like to receive the newsletter . </P> <P> <wd_idx<2020>> With a foundation of opted - in contact information stored <wd_idx<2030>> in their database , marketers can send out promotional materials <wd_idx<2040>> automatically using autoresponders -- known as drip marketing . They <wd_idx<2050>> can also segment their promotions to specific market segments . <wd_idx<2060>> </P> <H2> Legal requirements </H2> <H3> Australia </H3> <P> The <wd_idx<2070>> Australian Spam Act 2003 is enforced by the Australian Communications <wd_idx<2080>> and Media Authority , widely known as `` ACMA '' <wd_idx<2090>> . The act defines the term unsolicited electronic messages , <wd_idx<2100>> states how unsubscribe functions must work for commercial messages , <wd_idx<2110>> and gives other key information . Fines range with 3 <wd_idx<2120>> fines of AU $110,000 being issued to Virgin Blue Airlines <wd_idx<2130>> ( 2011 ) , Tiger Airways Holdings Limited ( 2012 <wd_idx<2140>> ) and Cellar master Wines Pty Limited ( 2013 ) <wd_idx<2150>> . </P> <H3> Canada </H3> <P> The `` Canada Anti-Spam <wd_idx\", \"<wd_idx<2120>> fines of AU $110,000 being issued to Virgin Blue Airlines <wd_idx<2130>> ( 2011 ) , Tiger Airways Holdings Limited ( 2012 <wd_idx<2140>> ) and Cellar master Wines Pty Limited ( 2013 ) <wd_idx<2150>> . </P> <H3> Canada </H3> <P> The `` Canada Anti-Spam <wd_idx<2160>> Law '' ( CASL ) went into effect on July <wd_idx<2170>> 1 , 2014 . CASL requires an explicit or implicit <wd_idx<2180>> opt - in from users , and the maximum fines <wd_idx<2190>> for noncompliance are CA $ 1 million for individuals and <wd_idx<2200>> $10 million for businesses . </P> <H3> European Union </H3> <wd_idx<2210>> <P> In 2002 the European Union ( EU ) introduced <wd_idx<2220>> the Directive on Privacy and Electronic Communications . Article 13 <wd_idx<2230>> of the Directive prohibits the use of personal email addresses <wd_idx<2240>> for marketing purposes . The Directive establishes the opt - <wd_idx<2250>> in regime , where unsolicited emails may be sent only <wd_idx<2260>> with prior agreement of the recipient ; this does not <wd_idx<2270>> apply to business email addresses . </P> <P> The directive <wd_idx<2280>> has since been incorporated into the laws of member states <wd_idx<2290>> . In the UK it is covered under the Privacy <wd_idx<2300>> and Electronic Communications ( EC Directive ) Regulations 2003 and <wd_idx<2310>> applies to all organizations that send out marketing by some <wd_idx<2320>> form of electronic communication . </P> <H3> United states </H3> <wd_idx<2330>> <P> The CAN - SPAM Act of 2003 was passed <wd_idx<2340>> by Congress as a direct response of the growing number <wd_idx<2350>> of complaints over spam e-mails . Congress determined that the <wd_idx<2360>> US government was showing an increased interest in the regulation <wd_idx<2370>> of commercial electronic mail nationally , that those who send <wd_idx<2380>> commercial e-mails should not mislead recipients over the source or <wd_idx<2390>> content of them , and that all recipients of such <wd_idx<2400>> emails have a right to decline them . The act <wd_idx<2410>> authorizes a US $16,000 penalty per violation for spamming each <wd_idx<2420>> individual recipient . However , it does not ban spam <wd_idx<2430>> emailing outright , but imposes laws on using deceptive marketing <wd_idx<2440>> methods through headings which are `` materially false or misleading <wd_idx<2450>> '' . In addition there are conditions which email marketers <wd_idx<2460>> must meet in terms of their format , their content <wd_idx<2470>> and labeling . As a result , many commercial email <wd_idx<2480>> marketers within the United States utilize a service or special <wd_idx<2490>> software to ensure compliance with the act . A variety <wd_idx<2500>> of older systems exist that do not ensure compliance with <wd_idx<2510>> the act . To comply with the act 's regulation <wd_idx<2520>> of commercial email , services also typically require users to <wd_idx<2530>> authenticate their return address and include a valid physical address <wd_idx<2540>> , provide a one - click unsubscribe feature , and <wd_idx<2550>> prohibit importing lists of purchased addresses that may not have <wd_idx<2560>> given valid permission . </P> <P> In addition to satisfying <wd_idx<2570>> legal requirements , email service providers ( ESPs ) began <wd_idx<2580>> to help customers establish and manage their own email marketing <wd_idx<2590>> campaigns . The service providers supply email templates and general <wd_idx<2600>> best practices , as well as methods for handling subscriptions <wd_idx<2610>> and cancellations automatically .

In its broadest sense , every email sent to a potential or current customer could be considered email marketing . It usually involves using email to send advertisements , request business , or solicit sales or donations , and is meant to build loyalty , trust , or brand awareness . Marketing emails can be sent to a purchased lead list or a current customer database . The term usually refers to sending email messages with the purpose of enhancing a merchant 's relationship with current or previous customers , encouraging customer loyalty and repeat business , acquiring new customers or convincing current customers to purchase something immediately , and sharing third - party ads . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 History </Li> <Li> 2 Types <Ul> <Li> 2.1 Transactional emails </Li> <Li> 2.2 Direct emails <Ul> <Li> 2.2. 1 Mobile email marketing </Li> </Ul> </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 3 Comparison to traditional mail <Ul> <Li> 3.1 Advantages </Li> <Li> 3.2 Disadvantages </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 4 Opt - in email advertising </Li> <Li> 5 Legal requirements <Ul> <Li> 5.1 Australia </Li> <Li> 5.2 Canada </Li> <Li> 5.3 European Union </Li> <Li> 5.4 United States </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 6 See also </Li> <Li> 7 References </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> History </H2> <P> Email marketing has evolved rapidly alongside the technological growth of the 21st century . Prior to this growth , when emails were novelties to the majority of customers , email marketing was not as effective . In 1978 , Gary Thuerk of Digital Equipment Corporation ( DEC ) sent out the first mass email to approximately 400 potential clients via the Advanced Research Projects Agency Network ( ARPANET ) . This email resulted in $13 million worth of sales in DEC products , and highlighted the potential of marketing through mass emails . However , as email marketing developed as an effective means of direct communication , users began blocking out content from emails with filters and blocking programs . In order to effectively communicate a message through email , marketers had to develop a way of pushing content through to the end user , without being cut out by automatic filters and spam removing software . This resulted in the birth of triggered marketing emails , which are sent to specific users based on their tracked online browsing patterns . </P> <P> Historically , it has been difficult to measure the effectiveness of marketing campaigns because target markets can not be adequately defined . Email marketing carries the benefit of allowing marketers to identify returns on investment and measure and improve efficiency . Email marketing allows marketers to see feedback from users in real time , and to monitor how effective their campaign is in achieving market penetration , revealing a communication channel 's scope . At the same time , however , it also means that the more personal nature of certain advertising methods , such as television advertisements , can not be captured . </P> <H2> Types </H2> <P> Email marketing can be carried out through different types of emails : </P> <H3> Transactional emails </H3> <P> Transactional emails are usually triggered based on a customer 's action with a company . To be qualified as transactional or relationship messages , these communications ' primary purpose must be `` to facilitate , complete , or confirm a commercial transaction that the recipient has previously agreed to enter into with the sender '' along with a few other narrow definitions of transactional messaging . Triggered transactional messages include dropped basket messages , password reset emails , purchase or order confirmation emails , order status emails , reorder emails , and email receipts . </P> <P> The primary purpose of a transactional email is to convey information regarding the action that triggered it . But , due to their high open rates ( 51.3 % compared to 36.6 % for email newsletters ) , transactional emails are an opportunity to introduce or extend the email relationship with customers or subscribers ; to anticipate and answer questions ; or to cross-sell or up - sell products or services . </P> <P> Many email newsletter software vendors offer transactional email support , which gives companies the ability to include promotional messages within the body of transactional emails . There are also software vendors that offer specialized transactional email marketing services , which include providing targeted and personalized transactional email messages and running specific marketing campaigns ( such as customer referral programs ) . </P> <H3> Direct emails </H3> <P> Direct email involves sending an email solely to communicate a promotional message ( for example , a special offer or a product catalog ) . Companies usually collect a list of customer or prospect email addresses to send direct promotional messages to , or they rent a list of email addresses from service companies . Safe mail marketing is also used . </P> Mobile email marketing <P> Email marketing develops large amounts of traffic through smartphones and tablets . Marketers are researching ways to advertise to more users and to make them view advertising for longer . However , the rate of delivery is still relatively low due to better filtering - out of advertising and users having multiple email accounts for different purposes . Because emails are generated according to the tracked behavior of consumers , it is possible to send advertising which is based on the recipient 's behavior . Because of this , modern email marketing is perceived more often as a pull strategy rather than a push strategy . </P> <H2> Comparison to traditional mail </H2> <P> There are both advantages and disadvantages to using email marketing in comparison to traditional advertising mail . </P> <H3> Advantages </H3> <P> Email marketing is popular with companies for several reasons : </P> <Ul> <Li> An exact return on investment can be tracked ( `` track to basket '' ) and has proven to be high when done properly . Email marketing is often reported as second only to search marketing as the most effective online marketing tactic . </Li> <Li> Email marketing is significantly cheaper and faster than traditional mail , mainly because of the high cost and time required in a traditional mail campaign for producing the artwork , printing , addressing , and mailing . </Li> <Li> Businesses and organizations who send a high volume of emails can use an ESP ( email service provider ) to gather information about the behavior of the recipients . The insights provided by consumer response to email marketing help businesses and organizations understand and make use of consumer behavior . </Li> <Li> Email provides a cost - effective method to test different marketing content , including visual , creative , marketing copy , and multimedia assets . The data gathered by testing in the email channel can then be used across all channels of marketing campaigns , both print and digital . </Li> <Li> Advertisers can reach substantial numbers of email subscribers who have opted in ( i.e. , consented ) to receive the email . </Li> <Li> Almost half of American Internet users check or send email on a typical day , with emails delivered between 1 am and 5 am local time outperforming those sent at other times in open and click rates . </Li> <Li> Email is popular with digital marketers , rising an estimated 15 % in 2009 to £ 292 million in the UK . </Li> <Li> If compared to standard email , direct email marketing produces higher response rate and higher average order value for e-commerce businesses . </Li> </Ul> <H3> Disadvantages </H3> <P> As of mid-2016 email deliverability is still an issue for legitimate marketers . According to the report , legitimate email servers averaged a delivery rate of 73 % in the U.S. ; six percent were filtered as spam , and 22 % were missing . This lags behind other countries : Australia delivers at 90 % , Canada at 89 % , Britain at 88 % , France at 84 % , Germany at 80 % and Brazil at 79 % . </P> <P> Additionally , consumers receive on average circa 90 emails per day . </P> <P> Companies considering the use of an email marketing program must make sure that their program does not violate spam laws such as the United States ' Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act ( CAN - SPAM ) , the European Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations 2003 , or their Internet service provider 's acceptable use policy . </P> <H2> Opt - in email advertising </H2> <P> Opt - in email advertising , or permission marketing , is a method of advertising via email whereby the recipient of the advertisement has consented to receive it . This method is one of several developed by marketers to eliminate the disadvantages of email marketing . </P> <P> Opt - in email marketing may evolve into a technology that uses a handshake protocol between the sender and receiver . This system is intended to eventually result in a high degree of satisfaction between consumers and marketers . If opt - in email advertising is used , the material that is emailed to consumers will be `` anticipated '' . It is assumed that the recipient wants to receive it , which makes it unlike unsolicited advertisements sent to the consumer . Ideally , opt - in email advertisements will be more personal and relevant to the consumer than untargeted advertisements . </P> <P> A common example of permission marketing is a newsletter sent to an advertising firm 's customers . Such newsletters inform customers of upcoming events or promotions , or new products . In this type of advertising , a company that wants to send a newsletter to their customers may ask them at the point of purchase if they would like to receive the newsletter . </P> <P> With a foundation of opted - in contact information stored in their database , marketers can send out promotional materials automatically using autoresponders -- known as drip marketing . They can also segment their promotions to specific market segments . </P> <H2> Legal requirements </H2> <H3> Australia </H3> <P> The Australian Spam Act 2003 is enforced by the Australian Communications and Media Authority , widely known as `` ACMA '' . The act defines the term unsolicited electronic messages , states how unsubscribe functions must work for commercial messages , and gives other key information . Fines range with 3 fines of AU $110,000 being issued to Virgin Blue Airlines ( 2011 ) , Tiger Airways Holdings Limited ( 2012 ) and Cellar master Wines Pty Limited ( 2013 ) . </P> <H3> Canada </H3> <P> The `` Canada Anti-Spam Law '' ( CASL ) went into effect on July 1 , 2014 . CASL requires an explicit or implicit opt - in from users , and the maximum fines for noncompliance are CA $ 1 million for individuals and $10 million for businesses . </P> <H3> European Union </H3> <P> In 2002 the European Union ( EU ) introduced the Directive on Privacy and Electronic Communications . Article 13 of the Directive prohibits the use of personal email addresses for marketing purposes . The Directive establishes the opt - in regime , where unsolicited emails may be sent only with prior agreement of the recipient ; this does not apply to business email addresses . </P> <P> The directive has since been incorporated into the laws of member states . In the UK it is covered under the Privacy and Electronic Communications ( EC Directive ) Regulations 2003 and applies to all organizations that send out marketing by some form of electronic communication . </P> <H3> United states </H3> <P> The CAN - SPAM Act of 2003 was passed by Congress as a direct response of the growing number of complaints over spam e-mails . Congress determined that the US government was showing an increased interest in the regulation of commercial electronic mail nationally , that those who send commercial e-mails should not mislead recipients over the source or content of them , and that all recipients of such emails have a right to decline them . The act authorizes a US $16,000 penalty per violation for spamming each individual recipient . However , it does not ban spam emailing outright , but imposes laws on using deceptive marketing methods through headings which are `` materially false or misleading '' . In addition there are conditions which email marketers must meet in terms of their format , their content and labeling . As a result , many commercial email marketers within the United States utilize a service or special software to ensure compliance with the act . A variety of older systems exist that do not ensure compliance with the act . To comply with the act 's regulation of commercial email , services also typically require users to authenticate their return address and include a valid physical address , provide a one - click unsubscribe feature , and prohibit importing lists of purchased addresses that may not have given valid permission . </P> <P> In addition to satisfying legal requirements , email service providers ( ESPs ) began to help customers establish and manage their own email marketing campaigns . The service providers supply email templates and general best practices , as well as methods for handling subscriptions and cancellations automatically . Some ESPs will provide insight and assistance with deliverability issues for major email providers . They also provide statistics pertaining to the number of messages received and opened , and whether the recipients clicked on any links within the messages . </P> <P> The CAN - SPAM Act was updated with some new regulations including a no - fee provision for opting out , further definition of `` sender '' , post office or private mail boxes count as a `` valid physical postal address '' and definition of `` person '' . These new provisions went into effect on July 7 , 2008 . </P> <H2> See also </H2> <Ul> <Li> CAUCE -- Coalition Against Unsolicited Commercial Email </Li> <Li> Customer engagement </Li> <Li> Suppression list </Li> <Li> Email spam - Unsolicited email marketing </Li> </Ul> <H2> References </H2> <Ol> <Li> Jump up ^ `` spam unsolicited e-mail '' .

In its broadest sense , every email <wd_idx<350>> sent to a potential or current customer could be considered <wd_idx<360>> email marketing . It usually involves using email to send <wd_idx<370>> advertisements , request business , or solicit sales or donations <wd_idx<380>> , and is meant to build loyalty , trust , <wd_idx<390>> or brand awareness .

Prior to <wd_idx<580>> this growth , when emails were novelties to the majority <wd_idx<590>> of customers , email marketing was not as effective . <wd_idx<600>> In 1978 , Gary Thuerk of Digital Equipment Corporation ( <wd_idx<610>> DEC ) sent out the first mass email to approximately <wd_idx<620>> 400 potential clients via the Advanced Research Projects Agency Network <wd_idx<630>> ( ARPANET ) . This email resulted in $13 million <wd_idx<640>> worth of sales in DEC products , and highlighted the <wd_idx<650>> potential of marketing through mass emails . However , as <wd_idx<660>> email marketing developed as an effective means of direct communication <wd_idx<670>> , users began blocking out content from emails with filters <wd_idx<680>> and blocking programs . In order to effectively communicate a <wd_idx<690>> message through email , marketers had to develop a way <wd_idx<700>> of pushing content through to the end user , without <wd_idx<710>> being cut out by automatic filters and spam removing software <wd_idx<720>> . This resulted in the birth of triggered marketing emails <wd_idx<730>> , which are sent to specific users based on their <wd_idx<740>> tracked online browsing patterns . </P> <P> Historically , it <wd_idx<750>> has been difficult to measure the effectiveness of marketing campaigns <wd_idx<760>> because target markets can not be adequately defined . Email <wd_idx<770>> marketing carries the benefit of allowing marketers to identify returns <wd_idx<780>> on investment and measure and improve efficiency . Email marketing <wd_idx<790>> allows marketers to see feedback from users in real time <wd_idx<800>> , and to monitor how effective their campaign is in <wd_idx<810>> achieving market penetration , revealing a communication channel 's scope <wd_idx<820>> . At\", \"<wd_idx<770>> marketing carries the benefit of allowing marketers to identify returns <wd_idx<780>> on investment and measure and improve efficiency .

At the same time , however , it also <wd_idx<830>> means that the more personal nature of certain advertising methods <wd_idx<840>> , such as television advertisements , can not be captured <wd_idx<850>> . </P> <H2> Types </H2> <P> Email marketing can be <wd_idx<860>> carried out through different types of emails : </P> <H3> <wd_idx<870>> Transactional emails </H3> <P> Transactional emails are usually triggered based <wd_idx<880>> on a customer 's action with a company . To <wd_idx<890>> be qualified as transactional or relationship messages , these communications <wd_idx<900>> ' primary purpose must be `` to facilitate , complete <wd_idx<910>> , or confirm a commercial transaction that the recipient has <wd_idx<920>> previously agreed to enter into with the sender '' along <wd_idx<930>> with a few other narrow definitions of transactional messaging . <wd_idx<940>> Triggered transactional messages include dropped basket messages , password reset <wd_idx<950>> emails , purchase or order confirmation emails , order status <wd_idx<960>> emails , reorder emails , and email receipts . </P> <wd_idx<970>> <P> The primary purpose of a transactional email is to <wd_idx<980>> convey information regarding the action that triggered it . But <wd_idx<990>> , due to their high open rates ( 51.3 % <wd_idx<1000>> compared to 36.6 % for email newsletters ) , transactional <wd_idx<1010>> emails are an opportunity to introduce or extend the email <wd_idx<1020>> relationship with customers or subscribers ; to anticipate and answer <wd_idx<1030>> questions ; or to cross-sell or up - sell products <wd_idx<1040>> or services . </P> <P> Many email newsletter software vendors <wd_idx<1050>> offer transactional email support , which gives companies the ability <wd_idx<1060>> to include promotional messages within the body of transactional emails <wd_idx<1070>> . There are also software vendors that offer specialized transactional <wd_idx<1080>> email marketing services , which include providing targeted and personalized <wd_idx<1090>> transactional email messages and running specific marketing campaigns ( such <wd_idx<1100>> as customer referral programs ) . </P> <H3> Direct emails <wd_idx<1110>> </H3> <P> Direct email involves sending an email solely to <wd_idx<1120>> communicate a promotional message ( for example , a special <wd_idx<1130>> offer or a product catalog ) . Companies usually collect <wd_idx<1140>> a list of customer or prospect email addresses to send <wd_idx<1150>> direct promotional messages to , or they rent a list <wd_idx<1160>> of email addresses from service companies . Safe mail marketing <wd_idx<1170>> is also used . </P> Mobile email marketing <P> Email <wd_idx<1180>> marketing develops large amounts of traffic through smartphones and tablets <wd_idx<1190>> . Marketers are researching ways to advertise to more users <wd_idx<1200>> and to make them view advertising for longer . However <wd_idx<1210>> , the rate of delivery is still relatively low due <wd_idx<1220>> to better filtering - out of advertising and users having <wd_idx<1230>> multiple email accounts for different purposes . Because emails are <wd_idx<1240>> generated according to the tracked behavior of consumers , it <wd_idx<1250>> is possible to send advertising which is based on the <wd_idx<1260>> recipient 's behavior . Because of this , modern email <wd_idx<1270>> marketing is perceived more often as a pull strategy rather <wd_idx\", \"<wd_idx<1230>> multiple email accounts for different purposes .

Email marketing is often reported as second <wd_idx<1360>> only to search marketing as the most effective online marketing <wd_idx<1370>> tactic . </Li> <Li> Email marketing is significantly cheaper and <wd_idx<1380>> faster than traditional mail , mainly because of the high <wd_idx<1390>> cost and time required in a traditional mail campaign for <wd_idx<1400>> producing the artwork , printing , addressing , and mailing <wd_idx<1410>> . </Li> <Li> Businesses and organizations who send a high <wd_idx<1420>> volume of emails can use an ESP ( email service <wd_idx<1430>> provider ) to gather information about the behavior of the <wd_idx<1440>> recipients .

This <wd_idx<1830>> method is one of several developed by marketers to eliminate <wd_idx<1840>> the disadvantages of email marketing . </P> <P> Opt - <wd_idx<1850>> in email marketing may evolve into a technology that uses <wd_idx<1860>> a handshake protocol between the sender and receiver . This <wd_idx<1870>> system is intended to eventually result in a high degree <wd_idx<1880>> of satisfaction between consumers and marketers . If opt - <wd_idx<1890>> in email advertising is used , the material that is <wd_idx<1900>> emailed to consumers will be `` anticipated '' . It <wd_idx<1910>> is assumed that the recipient wants to receive it , <wd_idx<1920>> which makes it unlike unsolicited advertisements sent to the consumer <wd_idx<1930>> . Ideally , opt - in email advertisements will be <wd_idx<1940>> more personal and relevant to the consumer than untargeted advertisements <wd_idx<1950>> . </P> <P> A common example of permission marketing is <wd_idx<1960>> a newsletter sent to an advertising firm 's customers . <wd_idx<1970>> Such newsletters inform customers of upcoming events or promotions , <wd_idx<1980>> or new products . In this type of advertising , <wd_idx<1990>> a company that wants to send a newsletter to their <wd_idx<2000>> customers may ask them at the point of purchase if <wd_idx<2010>> they would like to receive the newsletter . </P> <P> <wd_idx<2020>> With a foundation of opted - in contact information stored <wd_idx<2030>> in their database , marketers can send out promotional materials <wd_idx<2040>> automatically using autoresponders -- known as drip marketing . They <wd_idx<2050>> can also segment their promotions to specific market segments . <wd_idx<2060>> </P> <H2> Legal requirements </H2> <H3> Australia </H3> <P> The <wd_idx<2070>> Australian Spam Act 2003 is enforced by the Australian Communications <wd_idx<2080>> and Media Authority , widely known as `` ACMA '' <wd_idx<2090>> . The act defines the term unsolicited electronic messages , <wd_idx<2100>> states how unsubscribe functions must work for commercial messages , <wd_idx<2110>> and gives other key information . Fines range with 3 <wd_idx<2120>> fines of AU $110,000 being issued to Virgin Blue Airlines <wd_idx<2130>> ( 2011 ) , Tiger Airways Holdings Limited ( 2012 <wd_idx<2140>> ) and Cellar master Wines Pty Limited ( 2013 ) <wd_idx<2150>> . </P> <H3> Canada </H3> <P> The `` Canada Anti-Spam <wd_idx\", \"<wd_idx<2120>> fines of AU $110,000 being issued to Virgin Blue Airlines <wd_idx<2130>> ( 2011 ) , Tiger Airways Holdings Limited ( 2012 <wd_idx<2140>> ) and Cellar master Wines Pty Limited ( 2013 ) <wd_idx<2150>> . </P> <H3> Canada </H3> <P> The `` Canada Anti-Spam <wd_idx<2160>> Law '' ( CASL ) went into effect on July <wd_idx<2170>> 1 , 2014 . CASL requires an explicit or implicit <wd_idx<2180>> opt - in from users , and the maximum fines <wd_idx<2190>> for noncompliance are CA $ 1 million for individuals and <wd_idx<2200>> $10 million for businesses . </P> <H3> European Union </H3> <wd_idx<2210>> <P> In 2002 the European Union ( EU ) introduced <wd_idx<2220>> the Directive on Privacy and Electronic Communications . Article 13 <wd_idx<2230>> of the Directive prohibits the use of personal email addresses <wd_idx<2240>> for marketing purposes . The Directive establishes the opt - <wd_idx<2250>> in regime , where unsolicited emails may be sent only <wd_idx<2260>> with prior agreement of the recipient ; this does not <wd_idx<2270>> apply to business email addresses . </P> <P> The directive <wd_idx<2280>> has since been incorporated into the laws of member states <wd_idx<2290>> . In the UK it is covered under the Privacy <wd_idx<2300>> and Electronic Communications ( EC Directive ) Regulations 2003 and <wd_idx<2310>> applies to all organizations that send out marketing by some <wd_idx<2320>> form of electronic communication . </P> <H3> United states </H3> <wd_idx<2330>> <P> The CAN - SPAM Act of 2003 was passed <wd_idx<2340>> by Congress as a direct response of the growing number <wd_idx<2350>> of complaints over spam e-mails . Congress determined that the <wd_idx<2360>> US government was showing an increased interest in the regulation <wd_idx<2370>> of commercial electronic mail nationally , that those who send <wd_idx<2380>> commercial e-mails should not mislead recipients over the source or <wd_idx<2390>> content of them , and that all recipients of such <wd_idx<2400>> emails have a right to decline them . The act <wd_idx<2410>> authorizes a US $16,000 penalty per violation for spamming each <wd_idx<2420>> individual recipient . However , it does not ban spam <wd_idx<2430>> emailing outright , but imposes laws on using deceptive marketing <wd_idx<2440>> methods through headings which are `` materially false or misleading <wd_idx<2450>> '' . In addition there are conditions which email marketers <wd_idx<2460>> must meet in terms of their format , their content <wd_idx<2470>> and labeling . As a result , many commercial email <wd_idx<2480>> marketers within the United States utilize a service or special <wd_idx<2490>> software to ensure compliance with the act . A variety <wd_idx<2500>> of older systems exist that do not ensure compliance with <wd_idx<2510>> the act . To comply with the act 's regulation <wd_idx<2520>> of commercial email , services also typically require users to <wd_idx<2530>> authenticate their return address and include a valid physical address <wd_idx<2540>> , provide a one - click unsubscribe feature , and <wd_idx<2550>> prohibit importing lists of purchased addresses that may not have <wd_idx<2560>> given valid permission . </P> <P> In addition to satisfying <wd_idx<2570>> legal requirements , email service providers ( ESPs ) began <wd_idx<2580>> to help customers establish and manage their own email marketing <wd_idx<2590>> campaigns . The service providers supply email templates and general <wd_idx<2600>> best practices , as well as methods for handling subscriptions <wd_idx<2610>> and cancellations automatically . Some ESPs will provide insight and <wd_\", \"<wd_idx<2570>> legal requirements , email service providers ( ESPs ) began <wd_idx<2580>> to help customers establish and manage their own email marketing <wd_idx<2590>> campaigns .

Some ESPs will provide insight and <wd_idx<2620>> assistance with deliverability issues for major email providers . They <wd_idx<2630>> also provide statistics pertaining to the number of messages received <wd_idx<2640>> and opened , and whether the recipients clicked on any <wd_idx<2650>> links within the messages . </P> <P> The CAN - <wd_idx<2660>> SPAM Act was updated with some new regulations including a <wd_idx<2670>> no - fee provision for opting out , further definition <wd_idx<2680>> of `` sender '' , post office or private mail <wd_idx<2690>> boxes count as a `` valid physical postal address '' <wd_idx<2700>> and definition of `` person '' .

In its broadest sense , every email sent to a potential or current customer could be considered email marketing . It usually involves using email to send advertisements , request business , or solicit sales or donations , and is meant to build loyalty , trust , or brand awareness . Marketing emails can be sent to a purchased lead list or a current customer database . The term usually refers to sending email messages with the purpose of enhancing a merchant 's relationship with current or previous customers , encouraging customer loyalty and repeat business , acquiring new customers or convincing current customers to purchase something immediately , and sharing third - party ads . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 History </Li> <Li> 2 Types <Ul> <Li> 2.1 Transactional emails </Li> <Li> 2.2 Direct emails <Ul> <Li> 2.2. 1 Mobile email marketing </Li> </Ul> </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 3 Comparison to traditional mail <Ul> <Li> 3.1 Advantages </Li> <Li> 3.2 Disadvantages </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 4 Opt - in email advertising </Li> <Li> 5 Legal requirements <Ul> <Li> 5.1 Australia </Li> <Li> 5.2 Canada </Li> <Li> 5.3 European Union </Li> <Li> 5.4 United States </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 6 See also </Li> <Li> 7 References </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> History </H2> <P> Email marketing has evolved rapidly alongside the technological growth of the 21st century . Prior to this growth , when emails were novelties to the majority of customers , email marketing was not as effective . In 1978 , Gary Thuerk of Digital Equipment Corporation ( DEC ) sent out the first mass email to approximately 400 potential clients via the Advanced Research Projects Agency Network ( ARPANET ) . This email resulted in $13 million worth of sales in DEC products , and highlighted the potential of marketing through mass emails . However , as email marketing developed as an effective means of direct communication , users began blocking out content from emails with filters and blocking programs . In order to effectively communicate a message through email , marketers had to develop a way of pushing content through to the end user , without being cut out by automatic filters and spam removing software . This resulted in the birth of triggered marketing emails , which are sent to specific users based on their tracked online browsing patterns . </P> <P> Historically , it has been difficult to measure the effectiveness of marketing campaigns because target markets can not be adequately defined . Email marketing carries the benefit of allowing marketers to identify returns on investment and measure and improve efficiency . Email marketing allows marketers to see feedback from users in real time , and to monitor how effective their campaign is in achieving market penetration , revealing a communication channel 's scope . At the same time , however , it also means that the more personal nature of certain advertising methods , such as television advertisements , can not be captured . </P> <H2> Types </H2> <P> Email marketing can be carried out through different types of emails : </P> <H3> Transactional emails </H3> <P> Transactional emails are usually triggered based on a customer 's action with a company . To be qualified as transactional or relationship messages , these communications ' primary purpose must be `` to facilitate , complete , or confirm a commercial transaction that the recipient has previously agreed to enter into with the sender '' along with a few other narrow definitions of transactional messaging . Triggered transactional messages include dropped basket messages , password reset emails , purchase or order confirmation emails , order status emails , reorder emails , and email receipts . </P> <P> The primary purpose of a transactional email is to convey information regarding the action that triggered it . But , due to their high open rates ( 51.3 % compared to 36.6 % for email newsletters ) , transactional emails are an opportunity to introduce or extend the email relationship with customers or subscribers ; to anticipate and answer questions ; or to cross-sell or up - sell products or services . </P> <P> Many email newsletter software vendors offer transactional email support , which gives companies the ability to include promotional messages within the body of transactional emails . There are also software vendors that offer specialized transactional email marketing services , which include providing targeted and personalized transactional email messages and running specific marketing campaigns ( such as customer referral programs ) . </P> <H3> Direct emails </H3> <P> Direct email involves sending an email solely to communicate a promotional message ( for example , a special offer or a product catalog ) . Companies usually collect a list of customer or prospect email addresses to send direct promotional messages to , or they rent a list of email addresses from service companies . Safe mail marketing is also used . </P> Mobile email marketing <P> Email marketing develops large amounts of traffic through smartphones and tablets . Marketers are researching ways to advertise to more users and to make them view advertising for longer . However , the rate of delivery is still relatively low due to better filtering - out of advertising and users having multiple email accounts for different purposes . Because emails are generated according to the tracked behavior of consumers , it is possible to send advertising which is based on the recipient 's behavior . Because of this , modern email marketing is perceived more often as a pull strategy rather than a push strategy . </P> <H2> Comparison to traditional mail </H2> <P> There are both advantages and disadvantages to using email marketing in comparison to traditional advertising mail . </P> <H3> Advantages </H3> <P> Email marketing is popular with companies for several reasons : </P> <Ul> <Li> An exact return on investment can be tracked ( `` track to basket '' ) and has proven to be high when done properly . Email marketing is often reported as second only to search marketing as the most effective online marketing tactic . </Li> <Li> Email marketing is significantly cheaper and faster than traditional mail , mainly because of the high cost and time required in a traditional mail campaign for producing the artwork , printing , addressing , and mailing . </Li> <Li> Businesses and organizations who send a high volume of emails can use an ESP ( email service provider ) to gather information about the behavior of the recipients . The insights provided by consumer response to email marketing help businesses and organizations understand and make use of consumer behavior . </Li> <Li> Email provides a cost - effective method to test different marketing content , including visual , creative , marketing copy , and multimedia assets . The data gathered by testing in the email channel can then be used across all channels of marketing campaigns , both print and digital . </Li> <Li> Advertisers can reach substantial numbers of email subscribers who have opted in ( i.e. , consented ) to receive the email . </Li> <Li> Almost half of American Internet users check or send email on a typical day , with emails delivered between 1 am and 5 am local time outperforming those sent at other times in open and click rates . </Li> <Li> Email is popular with digital marketers , rising an estimated 15 % in 2009 to £ 292 million in the UK . </Li> <Li> If compared to standard email , direct email marketing produces higher response rate and higher average order value for e-commerce businesses . </Li> </Ul> <H3> Disadvantages </H3> <P> As of mid-2016 email deliverability is still an issue for legitimate marketers . According to the report , legitimate email servers averaged a delivery rate of 73 % in the U.S. ; six percent were filtered as spam , and 22 % were missing . This lags behind other countries : Australia delivers at 90 % , Canada at 89 % , Britain at 88 % , France at 84 % , Germany at 80 % and Brazil at 79 % . </P> <P> Additionally , consumers receive on average circa 90 emails per day . </P> <P> Companies considering the use of an email marketing program must make sure that their program does not violate spam laws such as the United States ' Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act ( CAN - SPAM ) , the European Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations 2003 , or their Internet service provider 's acceptable use policy . </P> <H2> Opt - in email advertising </H2> <P> Opt - in email advertising , or permission marketing , is a method of advertising via email whereby the recipient of the advertisement has consented to receive it . This method is one of several developed by marketers to eliminate the disadvantages of email marketing . </P> <P> Opt - in email marketing may evolve into a technology that uses a handshake protocol between the sender and receiver . This system is intended to eventually result in a high degree of satisfaction between consumers and marketers . If opt - in email advertising is used , the material that is emailed to consumers will be `` anticipated '' . It is assumed that the recipient wants to receive it , which makes it unlike unsolicited advertisements sent to the consumer . Ideally , opt - in email advertisements will be more personal and relevant to the consumer than untargeted advertisements . </P> <P> A common example of permission marketing is a newsletter sent to an advertising firm 's customers . Such newsletters inform customers of upcoming events or promotions , or new products . In this type of advertising , a company that wants to send a newsletter to their customers may ask them at the point of purchase if they would like to receive the newsletter . </P> <P> With a foundation of opted - in contact information stored in their database , marketers can send out promotional materials automatically using autoresponders -- known as drip marketing . They can also segment their promotions to specific market segments . </P> <H2> Legal requirements </H2> <H3> Australia </H3> <P> The Australian Spam Act 2003 is enforced by the Australian Communications and Media Authority , widely known as `` ACMA '' . The act defines the term unsolicited electronic messages , states how unsubscribe functions must work for commercial messages , and gives other key information . Fines range with 3 fines of AU $110,000 being issued to Virgin Blue Airlines ( 2011 ) , Tiger Airways Holdings Limited ( 2012 ) and Cellar master Wines Pty Limited ( 2013 ) . </P> <H3> Canada </H3> <P> The `` Canada Anti-Spam Law '' ( CASL ) went into effect on July 1 , 2014 . CASL requires an explicit or implicit opt - in from users , and the maximum fines for noncompliance are CA $ 1 million for individuals and $10 million for businesses . </P> <H3> European Union </H3> <P> In 2002 the European Union ( EU ) introduced the Directive on Privacy and Electronic Communications . Article 13 of the Directive prohibits the use of personal email addresses for marketing purposes . The Directive establishes the opt - in regime , where unsolicited emails may be sent only with prior agreement of the recipient ; this does not apply to business email addresses . </P> <P> The directive has since been incorporated into the laws of member states . In the UK it is covered under the Privacy and Electronic Communications ( EC Directive ) Regulations 2003 and applies to all organizations that send out marketing by some form of electronic communication . </P> <H3> United states </H3> <P> The CAN - SPAM Act of 2003 was passed by Congress as a direct response of the growing number of complaints over spam e-mails . Congress determined that the US government was showing an increased interest in the regulation of commercial electronic mail nationally , that those who send commercial e-mails should not mislead recipients over the source or content of them , and that all recipients of such emails have a right to decline them . The act authorizes a US $16,000 penalty per violation for spamming each individual recipient . However , it does not ban spam emailing outright , but imposes laws on using deceptive marketing methods through headings which are `` materially false or misleading '' . In addition there are conditions which email marketers must meet in terms of their format , their content and labeling . As a result , many commercial email marketers within the United States utilize a service or special software to ensure compliance with the act . A variety of older systems exist that do not ensure compliance with the act . To comply with the act 's regulation of commercial email , services also typically require users to authenticate their return address and include a valid physical address , provide a one - click unsubscribe feature , and prohibit importing lists of purchased addresses that may not have given valid permission . </P> <P> In addition to satisfying legal requirements , email service providers ( ESPs ) began to help customers establish and manage their own email marketing campaigns . The service providers supply email templates and general best practices , as well as methods for handling subscriptions and cancellations automatically . Some ESPs will provide insight and assistance with deliverability issues for major email providers . They also provide statistics pertaining to the number of messages received and opened , and whether the recipients clicked on any links within the messages . </P> <P> The CAN - SPAM Act was updated with some new regulations including a no - fee provision for opting out , further definition of `` sender '' , post office or private mail boxes count as a `` valid physical postal address '' and definition of `` person '' . These new provisions went into effect on July 7 , 2008 . </P> <H2> See also </H2> <Ul> <Li> CAUCE -- Coalition Against Unsolicited Commercial Email </Li> <Li> Customer engagement </Li> <Li> Suppression list </Li> <Li> Email spam - Unsolicited email marketing </Li> </Ul> <H2> References </H2> <Ol> <Li> Jump up ^ `` spam unsolicited e-mail '' .

To <wd_idx<890>> be qualified as transactional or relationship messages , these communications <wd_idx<900>> ' primary purpose must be `` to facilitate , complete <wd_idx<910>> , or confirm a commercial transaction that the recipient has <wd_idx<920>> previously agreed to enter into with the sender '' along <wd_idx<930>> with a few other narrow definitions of transactional messaging . <wd_idx<940>> Triggered transactional messages include dropped basket messages , password reset <wd_idx<950>> emails , purchase or order confirmation emails , order status <wd_idx<960>> emails , reorder emails , and email receipts . </P> <wd_idx<970>> <P> The primary purpose of a transactional email is to <wd_idx<980>> convey information regarding the action that triggered it . But <wd_idx<990>> , due to their high open rates ( 51.3 % <wd_idx<1000>> compared to 36.6 % for email newsletters ) , transactional <wd_idx<1010>> emails are an opportunity to introduce or extend the email <wd_idx<1020>> relationship with customers or subscribers ; to anticipate and answer <wd_idx<1030>> questions ; or to cross-sell or up - sell products <wd_idx<1040>> or services . </P> <P> Many email newsletter software vendors <wd_idx<1050>> offer transactional email support , which gives companies the ability <wd_idx<1060>> to include promotional messages within the body of transactional emails <wd_idx<1070>> . There are also software vendors that offer specialized transactional <wd_idx<1080>> email marketing services , which include providing targeted and personalized <wd_idx<1090>> transactional email messages and running specific marketing campaigns ( such <wd_idx<1100>> as customer referral programs ) . </P> <H3> Direct emails <wd_idx<1110>> </H3> <P> Direct email involves sending an email solely to <wd_idx<1120>> communicate a promotional message ( for example , a special <wd_idx<1130>> offer or a product catalog ) . Companies usually collect <wd_idx<1140>> a list of customer or prospect email addresses to send <wd_idx<1150>> direct promotional messages to , or they rent a list <wd_idx<1160>> of email addresses from service companies . Safe mail marketing <wd_idx<1170>> is also used . </P> Mobile email marketing <P> Email <wd_idx<1180>> marketing develops large amounts of traffic through smartphones and tablets <wd_idx<1190>> . Marketers are researching ways to advertise to more users <wd_idx<1200>> and to make them view advertising for longer . However <wd_idx<1210>> , the rate of delivery is still relatively low due <wd_idx<1220>> to better filtering - out of advertising and users having <wd_idx<1230>> multiple email accounts for different purposes . Because emails are <wd_idx<1240>> generated according to the tracked behavior of consumers , it <wd_idx<1250>> is possible to send advertising which is based on the <wd_idx<1260>> recipient 's behavior . Because of this , modern email <wd_idx<1270>> marketing is perceived more often as a pull strategy rather <wd_idx\", \"<wd_idx<1230>> multiple email accounts for different purposes . Because emails are <wd_idx<1240>> generated according to the tracked behavior of consumers , it <wd_idx<1250>> is possible to send advertising which is based on the <wd_idx<1260>> recipient 's behavior . Because of this , modern email <wd_idx<1270>> marketing is perceived more often as a pull strategy rather <wd_idx<1280>> than a push strategy . </P> <H2> Comparison to traditional <wd_idx<1290>> mail </H2> <P> There are both advantages and disadvantages to <wd_idx<1300>> using email marketing in comparison to traditional advertising mail . <wd_idx<1310>> </P> <H3> Advantages </H3> <P> Email marketing is popular with <wd_idx<1320>> companies for several reasons : </P> <Ul> <Li> An exact <wd_idx<1330>> return on investment can be tracked ( `` track to <wd_idx<1340>> basket '' ) and has proven to be high when <wd_idx<1350>> done properly . Email marketing is often reported as second <wd_idx<1360>> only to search marketing as the most effective online marketing <wd_idx<1370>> tactic . </Li> <Li> Email marketing is significantly cheaper and <wd_idx<1380>> faster than traditional mail , mainly because of the high <wd_idx<1390>> cost and time required in a traditional mail campaign for <wd_idx<1400>> producing the artwork , printing , addressing , and mailing <wd_idx<1410>> . </Li> <Li> Businesses and organizations who send a high <wd_idx<1420>> volume of emails can use an ESP ( email service <wd_idx<1430>> provider ) to gather information about the behavior of the <wd_idx<1440>> recipients . The insights provided by consumer response to email <wd_idx<1450>> marketing help businesses and organizations understand and make use of <wd_idx<1460>> consumer behavior . </Li> <Li> Email provides a cost - <wd_idx<1470>> effective method to test different marketing content , including visual <wd_idx<1480>> , creative , marketing copy , and multimedia assets . <wd_idx<1490>> The data gathered by testing in the email channel can <wd_idx<1500>> then be used across all channels of marketing campaigns , <wd_idx<1510>> both print and digital . </Li> <Li> Advertisers can reach <wd_idx<1520>> substantial numbers of email subscribers who have opted in ( <wd_idx<1530>> i.e. , consented ) to receive the email . </Li> <wd_idx<1540>> <Li> Almost half of American Internet users check or send <wd_idx<1550>> email on a typical day , with emails delivered between <wd_idx<1560>> 1 am and 5 am local time outperforming those sent <wd_idx<1570>> at other times in open and click rates . </Li> <wd_idx<1580>> <Li> Email is popular with digital marketers , rising an <wd_idx<1590>> estimated 15 % in 2009 to £ 292 million in <wd_idx<1600>> the UK . </Li> <Li> If compared to standard email <wd_idx<1610>> , direct email marketing produces higher response rate and higher <wd_idx<1620>> average order value for e-commerce businesses . </Li> </Ul> <H3> <wd_idx<1630>> Disadvantages </H3> <P> As of mid-2016 email deliverability is still <wd_idx<1640>> an issue for legitimate marketers . According to the report <wd_idx<1650>> , legitimate email servers averaged a delivery rate of 73 <wd_idx<1660>> % in the U.S. ; six percent were filtered as <wd_idx<1670>> spam , and 22 % were missing . This lags <wd_idx<1680>> behind other countries : Australia delivers at 90 % , <wd_idx<1690>> Canada at 89 % , Britain at 88 % , <wd_idx<1700>> France at 84 % , Germany at 80 % and <wd_idx<1710>> Brazil at 79 % . </P> <P> Additionally , consumers \", \"<wd_idx<1670>> spam , and 22 % were missing . This lags <wd_idx<1680>> behind other countries : Australia delivers at 90 % , <wd_idx<1690>> Canada at 89 % , Britain at 88 % , <wd_idx<1700>> France at 84 % , Germany at 80 % and <wd_idx<1710>> Brazil at 79 % . </P> <P> Additionally , consumers <wd_idx<1720>> receive on average circa 90 emails per day . </P> <wd_idx<1730>> <P> Companies considering the use of an email marketing program <wd_idx<1740>> must make sure that their program does not violate spam <wd_idx<1750>> laws such as the United States ' Controlling the Assault <wd_idx<1760>> of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act ( CAN - SPAM <wd_idx<1770>> ) , the European Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations 2003 <wd_idx<1780>> , or their Internet service provider 's acceptable use policy <wd_idx<1790>> . </P> <H2> Opt - in email advertising </H2> <P> <wd_idx<1800>> Opt - in email advertising , or permission marketing , <wd_idx<1810>> is a method of advertising via email whereby the recipient <wd_idx<1820>> of the advertisement has consented to receive it . This <wd_idx<1830>> method is one of several developed by marketers to eliminate <wd_idx<1840>> the disadvantages of email marketing . </P> <P> Opt - <wd_idx<1850>> in email marketing may evolve into a technology that uses <wd_idx<1860>> a handshake protocol between the sender and receiver . This <wd_idx<1870>> system is intended to eventually result in a high degree <wd_idx<1880>> of satisfaction between consumers and marketers . If opt - <wd_idx<1890>> in email advertising is used , the material that is <wd_idx<1900>> emailed to consumers will be `` anticipated '' . It <wd_idx<1910>> is assumed that the recipient wants to receive it , <wd_idx<1920>> which makes it unlike unsolicited advertisements sent to the consumer <wd_idx<1930>> . Ideally , opt - in email advertisements will be <wd_idx<1940>> more personal and relevant to the consumer than untargeted advertisements <wd_idx<1950>> . </P> <P> A common example of permission marketing is <wd_idx<1960>> a newsletter sent to an advertising firm 's customers . <wd_idx<1970>> Such newsletters inform customers of upcoming events or promotions , <wd_idx<1980>> or new products . In this type of advertising , <wd_idx<1990>> a company that wants to send a newsletter to their <wd_idx<2000>> customers may ask them at the point of purchase if <wd_idx<2010>> they would like to receive the newsletter . </P> <P> <wd_idx<2020>> With a foundation of opted - in contact information stored <wd_idx<2030>> in their database , marketers can send out promotional materials <wd_idx<2040>> automatically using autoresponders -- known as drip marketing . They <wd_idx<2050>> can also segment their promotions to specific market segments . <wd_idx<2060>> </P> <H2> Legal requirements </H2> <H3> Australia </H3> <P> The <wd_idx<2070>> Australian Spam Act 2003 is enforced by the Australian Communications <wd_idx<2080>> and Media Authority , widely known as `` ACMA '' <wd_idx<2090>> . The act defines the term unsolicited electronic messages , <wd_idx<2100>> states how unsubscribe functions must work for commercial messages , <wd_idx<2110>> and gives other key information . Fines range with 3 <wd_idx<2120>> fines of AU $110,000 being issued to Virgin Blue Airlines <wd_idx<2130>> ( 2011 ) , Tiger Airways Holdings Limited ( 2012 <wd_idx<2140>> ) and Cellar master Wines Pty Limited ( 2013 ) <wd_idx<2150>> . </P> <H3> Canada </H3> <P> The `` Canada Anti-Spam <wd_idx\", \"<wd_idx<2120>> fines of AU $110,000 being issued to Virgin Blue Airlines <wd_idx<2130>> ( 2011 ) , Tiger Airways Holdings Limited ( 2012 <wd_idx<2140>> ) and Cellar master Wines Pty Limited ( 2013 ) <wd_idx<2150>> . </P> <H3> Canada </H3> <P> The `` Canada Anti-Spam <wd_idx<2160>> Law '' ( CASL ) went into effect on July <wd_idx<2170>> 1 , 2014 . CASL requires an explicit or implicit <wd_idx<2180>> opt - in from users , and the maximum fines <wd_idx<2190>> for noncompliance are CA $ 1 million for individuals and <wd_idx<2200>> $10 million for businesses . </P> <H3> European Union </H3> <wd_idx<2210>> <P> In 2002 the European Union ( EU ) introduced <wd_idx<2220>> the Directive on Privacy and Electronic Communications . Article 13 <wd_idx<2230>> of the Directive prohibits the use of personal email addresses <wd_idx<2240>> for marketing purposes . The Directive establishes the opt - <wd_idx<2250>> in regime , where unsolicited emails may be sent only <wd_idx<2260>> with prior agreement of the recipient ; this does not <wd_idx<2270>> apply to business email addresses . </P> <P> The directive <wd_idx<2280>> has since been incorporated into the laws of member states <wd_idx<2290>> . In the UK it is covered under the Privacy <wd_idx<2300>> and Electronic Communications ( EC Directive ) Regulations 2003 and <wd_idx<2310>> applies to all organizations that send out marketing by some <wd_idx<2320>> form of electronic communication . </P> <H3> United states </H3> <wd_idx<2330>> <P> The CAN - SPAM Act of 2003 was passed <wd_idx<2340>> by Congress as a direct response of the growing number <wd_idx<2350>> of complaints over spam e-mails . Congress determined that the <wd_idx<2360>> US government was showing an increased interest in the regulation <wd_idx<2370>> of commercial electronic mail nationally , that those who send <wd_idx<2380>> commercial e-mails should not mislead recipients over the source or <wd_idx<2390>> content of them , and that all recipients of such <wd_idx<2400>> emails have a right to decline them . The act <wd_idx<2410>> authorizes a US $16,000 penalty per violation for spamming each <wd_idx<2420>> individual recipient . However , it does not ban spam <wd_idx<2430>> emailing outright , but imposes laws on using deceptive marketing <wd_idx<2440>> methods through headings which are `` materially false or misleading <wd_idx<2450>> '' . In addition there are conditions which email marketers <wd_idx<2460>> must meet in terms of their format , their content <wd_idx<2470>> and labeling . As a result , many commercial email <wd_idx<2480>> marketers within the United States utilize a service or special <wd_idx<2490>> software to ensure compliance with the act . A variety <wd_idx<2500>> of older systems exist that do not ensure compliance with <wd_idx<2510>> the act . To comply with the act 's regulation <wd_idx<2520>> of commercial email , services also typically require users to <wd_idx<2530>> authenticate their return address and include a valid physical address <wd_idx<2540>> , provide a one - click unsubscribe feature , and <wd_idx<2550>> prohibit importing lists of purchased addresses that may not have <wd_idx<2560>> given valid permission . </P> <P> In addition to satisfying <wd_idx<2570>> legal requirements , email service providers ( ESPs ) began <wd_idx<2580>> to help customers establish and manage their own email marketing <wd_idx<2590>> campaigns . The service providers supply email templates and general <wd_idx<2600>> best practices , as well as methods for handling subscriptions <wd_idx<2610>> and cancellations automatically . Some ESPs will provide insight and <wd_\", \"<wd_idx<2570>> legal requirements , email service providers ( ESPs ) began <wd_idx<2580>> to help customers establish and manage their own email marketing <wd_idx<2590>> campaigns .
