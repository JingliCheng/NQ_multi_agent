This form is filed in order to `` perfect '' a creditor 's security interest by giving public notice that there is a right to take possession of and sell certain assets for repayment of a specific debt with a certain priority . Such notices of sale are often found in the local newspapers . Once the form has been filed , the creditor establishes a relative priority with other creditors of the debtor . This process is also called `` perfecting the security interest '' in the property , and this type of loan is a secured loan . A financing statement may also be filed in the real estate records by a lessor of fixtures to establish the priority of the lessor 's rights against a holder of a mortgage or other lien on the real property . The creditor 's rights against the debtor and the lessor 's rights against the lessee are based on the credit documents and the lease , respectively , and not the financing statement . </P> <P> Pursuant to the standards set forth in the UCC , at 9 - 503 and 9 - 504 , the financing statement need only contain three pieces of information : </P> <Ol> <Li> the debtor 's name and address </Li> <Li> the creditor 's name and address </Li> <Li> an indication of the collateral , `` whether or not it is specific , if it reasonably identifies what is described .

However , an exception exists if the collateral is something that is tied to a particular piece of real property , such as timber , mineral rights , or fixtures . In that case , the filing must be made in the county where the property is located , usually in the recording office or county court , because that is where third parties are most likely to search for such record . </P> <P> In the case of a loan secured by personal property collateral , the filing of a financing statement gives notice of a lien against the property so that other lenders or buyers of the personal property will know of the security interest . In the case of a filing of a financing statement by a lessor of fixtures , the filing of the financing statement gives notice of the lessor 's interests to others who acquire an interest in the real property and related fixtures . The financing statement does not create a lien nor does it create any additional rights against a lessee in favor of a lessor , the filing of a financing statement just gives notice of whatever rights the creditor or lessor have under their loan documents or lease , respectively . </P> <H2> References ( edit ) </H2> <Ol> <Li> Jump up ^ http://www.findlegalforms.com/articles/form-encyclopedia/what-is-a-ucc1-financing-statement </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ http://biztaxlaw.about.com/od/glossaryu/g/ucc1statement.htm </Li> </Ol> Retrieved from `` https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=UCC-1_financing_statement&oldid=803697764 '' Categories : <Ul> <Li> Uniform Commercial Code </Li> <Li> Legal terminology </Li> </Ul> Hidden categories : <Ul> <Li> Articles needing additional references from October 2014 </Li> <Li> All articles needing additional references </Li> </Ul> <H2> </H2> <H3> </H3> <Ul> <Li> </Li> <Li> Talk </Li> <Li> </Li> <Li> </Li> <Li> </Li> </Ul> <H3> </H3> <Ul> <Li> </Li> <Li> </Li> </Ul> <H3> </H3> <Ul> </Ul> <H3> </H3> <Ul> <Li> </Li> <Li> </Li> <Li> </Li> </Ul> <H3> </H3> <Ul> </Ul> <H3> </H3> <H3> </H3> <Ul> <Li> </Li> <Li> </Li> <Li> </Li> <Li> </Li> <Li> </Li> <Li> </Li> <Li> </Li> </Ul> <H3> </H3> <Ul> <Li> </Li> <Li> About Wikipedia </Li> <Li> </Li> <Li> </Li> <Li> </Li> </Ul> <H3> </H3> <Ul> <Li> </Li> <Li> </Li> <Li> </Li> <Li> </Li> <Li> </Li> <Li> </Li> <Li> </Li> <Li> </Li> </Ul> <H3> </H3> <Ul> <Li> </Li> <Li> </Li> <Li> </Li> </Ul> <H3> </H3> <Ul> </Ul> Add links <Ul> <Li> This page was last edited on 4 October 2017 , at 02 : 00 . </Li> <Li> </Li> </Ul> <Ul> <Li> </Li> <Li> About Wikipedia </Li> <Li> </Li> <Li> </Li> <Li> </Li> <Li> </Li> <Li> </Li> <Li> </Li> </Ul> <Ul> <Li> </Li> <Li> </Li> </Ul> question: Can a UCC be filed on an individual\n",

( October 2014 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this template message ) </Td> </Tr> </Table> <P> A UCC - 1 financing statement ( an abbreviation for Uniform Commercial Code - 1 ) is a legal form that a creditor files to give notice that it has or may have an interest in the personal property of a debtor ( a person who owes a debt to the creditor as typically specified in the agreement creating the debt ) . This form is filed in order to `` perfect '' a creditor 's security interest by giving public notice that there is a right to take possession of and sell certain assets for repayment of a specific debt with a certain priority . Such notices of sale are often found in the local newspapers . Once the form has been filed , the creditor establishes a relative priority with other creditors of the debtor . This process is also called `` perfecting the security interest '' in the property , and this type of loan is a secured loan . A financing statement may also be filed in the real estate records by a lessor of fixtures to establish the priority of the lessor 's rights against a holder of a mortgage or other lien on the real property . The creditor 's rights against the debtor and the lessor 's rights against the lessee are based on the credit documents and the lease , respectively , and not the financing statement . </P> <P> Pursuant to the standards set forth in the UCC , at 9 - 503 and 9 - 504 , the financing statement need only contain three pieces of information : </P> <Ol> <Li> the debtor 's name and address </Li> <Li> the creditor 's name and address </Li> <Li> an indication of the collateral , `` whether or not it is specific , if it reasonably identifies what is described .

However , an exception exists if the collateral is something that is tied to a particular piece of real property , such as timber , mineral rights , or fixtures . In that case , the filing must be made in the county where the property is located , usually in the recording office or county court , because that is where third parties are most likely to search for such record . </P> <P> In the case of a loan secured by personal property collateral , the filing of a financing statement gives notice of a lien against the property so that other lenders or buyers of the personal property will know of the security interest . In the case of a filing of a financing statement by a lessor of fixtures , the filing of the financing statement gives notice of the lessor 's interests to others who acquire an interest in the real property and related fixtures . The financing statement does not create a lien nor does it create any additional rights against a lessee in favor of a lessor , the filing of a financing statement just gives notice of whatever rights the creditor or lessor have under their loan documents or lease , respectively . </P> <H2> References ( edit ) </H2> <Ol> <Li> Jump up ^ http://www.findlegalforms.com/articles/form-encyclopedia/what-is-a-ucc1-financing-statement </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ http://biztaxlaw.about.com/od/glossaryu/g/ucc1statement.htm </Li> </Ol> Retrieved from `` https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=UCC-1_financing_statement&oldid=803697764 '' Categories : <Ul> <Li> Uniform Commercial Code </Li> <Li> Legal terminology </Li> </Ul> Hidden categories : <Ul> <Li> Articles needing additional references from October 2014 </Li> <Li> All articles needing additional references </Li> </Ul> <H2> </H2> <H3> </H3> <Ul> <Li> </Li> <Li> Talk </Li> <Li> </Li> <Li> </Li> <Li> </Li> </Ul> <H3> </H3> <Ul> <Li> </Li> <Li> </Li> </Ul> <H3> </H3> <Ul> </Ul> <H3> </H3> <Ul> <Li> </Li> <Li> </Li> <Li> </Li> </Ul> <H3> </H3> <Ul> </Ul> <H3> </H3> <H3> </H3> <Ul> <Li> </Li> <Li> </Li> <Li> </Li> <Li> </Li> <Li> </Li> <Li> </Li> <Li> </Li> </Ul> <H3> </H3> <Ul> <Li> </Li> <Li> About Wikipedia </Li> <Li> </Li> <Li> </Li> <Li> </Li> </Ul> <H3> </H3> <Ul> <Li> </Li> <Li> </Li> <Li> </Li> <Li> </Li> <Li> </Li> <Li> </Li> <Li> </Li> <Li> </Li> </Ul> <H3> </H3> <Ul> <Li> </Li> <Li> </Li> <Li> </Li> </Ul> <H3> </H3> <Ul> </Ul> Add links <Ul> <Li> This page was last edited on 4 October 2017 , at 02 : 00 . </Li> <Li> </Li> </Ul> <Ul> <Li> </Li> <Li> About Wikipedia </Li> <Li> </Li> <Li> </Li> <Li> </Li> <Li> </Li> <Li> </Li> <Li> </Li> </Ul> <Ul> <Li> </Li> <Li> </Li> </Ul> question: Can a UCC be used to freeze an individual's assets\n",

'' ( UCC 9 - 108 ) </Li> </Ol> <wd_idx<390>> <P> The financing statement is generally filed with the office <wd_idx<400>> of the state secretary of state , in the state <wd_idx<410>> where the debtor is located - for an individual , <wd_idx<420>> the state where the debtor resides , for most kinds <wd_idx<430>> of business organizations the state of incorporation or organization . <wd_idx<440>> Many states have a state agency that operates under the <wd_idx<450>> secretary of state , which is tasked with overseeing business <wd_idx<460>> organizations and activities , including receipt of financing statements . <wd_idx<470>> However , an exception exists if the collateral is something <wd_idx<480>> that is tied to a particular piece of real property <wd_idx<490>> , such as timber , mineral rights , or fixtures <wd_idx<500>> . In that case , the filing must be made <wd_idx<510>> in the county\", \"<wd_idx<460>> organizations and activities , including receipt of financing statements . <wd_idx<470>> However , an exception exists if the collateral is something <wd_idx<480>> that is tied to a particular piece of real property <wd_idx<490>> , such as timber , mineral rights , or fixtures <wd_idx<500>> . In that case , the filing must be made <wd_idx<510>> in the county where the property is located , usually <wd_idx<520>> in the recording office or county court , because that <wd_idx<530>> is where third parties are most likely to search for <wd_idx<540>> such record . </P> <P> In the case of a <wd_idx<550>> loan secured by personal property collateral , the filing of <wd_idx<560>> a financing statement gives notice of a lien against the <wd_idx<570>> property so that other lenders or buyers of the personal <wd_idx<580>> property will know of the security interest . In the <wd_idx<590>> case of a filing of a financing statement by a <wd_idx<600>> lessor of fixtures , the filing of the financing statement <wd_idx<610>> gives notice of the lessor 's interests to others who <wd_idx<620>> acquire an interest in the real property and related fixtures <wd_idx<630>> . The financing statement does not create a lien nor <wd_idx<640>> does it create any additional rights against a lessee in <wd_idx<650>> favor of a lessor , the filing of a financing <wd_idx<660>> statement just gives notice of whatever rights the creditor or <wd_idx<670>> lessor have under their loan documents or lease , respectively <wd_idx<680>> . </P> <H2> References ( edit ) </H2> <Ol> <Li> <wd_idx<690>> Jump up ^ http://www.findlegalforms.com/articles/form-encyclopedia/what-is-a-ucc1-financing-statement </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ http://biztaxlaw.about.com/od/glossaryu/g/ucc1statement.htm <wd_idx<700>> </Li> </Ol> Retrieved from `` https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=UCC-1_financing_statement&oldid=803697764 '' Categories : <Ul> <wd_idx<710>> <Li> Uniform Commercial Code </Li> <Li> Legal terminology </Li> </Ul> <wd_idx<720>> Hidden categories : <Ul> <Li> Articles needing additional references from <wd_idx<730>> October 2014 </Li> <Li> All articles needing additional references </Li> <wd_idx<740>> </Ul> <H2> </H2> <H3> </H3> <Ul> <Li> </Li> <Li> Talk <wd_idx<750>> </Li> <Li> </Li> <Li> </Li> <Li> </Li> </Ul> <H3> </H3> <wd_idx<760>> <Ul> <Li> </Li> <Li> </Li> </Ul> <H3> </H3> <Ul> </Ul> <wd_idx<770>> <H3> </H3> <Ul> <Li> </Li> <Li> </Li> <Li> </Li> </Ul> <wd_idx<780>> <H3> </H3> <Ul> </Ul> <H3> </H3> <H3> </H3> <Ul> <Li> <wd_idx<790>> </Li> <Li> </Li> <Li> </Li> <Li> </Li> <Li> </Li> <Li> <wd_idx<800>> </Li> <Li> </Li> </Ul> <H3> </H3> <Ul> <Li> </Li> <Li> <wd_idx<810>> About Wikipedia </Li> <Li> </Li> <Li> </Li> <Li> </Li> </Ul> <wd_idx<820>> <H3> </H3> <Ul> <Li> </Li> <Li> </Li> <Li> </Li> <Li> <wd_idx<830>> </Li> <Li> </Li> <Li> </Li> <Li> </\", '<wd_idx<810>> About Wikipedia </Li> <Li> </Li> <Li> </Li> <Li> </Li> </Ul> <wd_idx<820>> <H3> </H3> <Ul> <Li> </Li> <Li> </Li> <Li> </Li> <Li> <wd_idx<830>> </Li> <Li> </Li> <Li> </Li> <Li> </Li> <Li> </Li> </Ul> <wd_idx<840>> <H3> </H3> <Ul> <Li> </Li> <Li> </Li> <Li> </Li> </Ul> <wd_idx<850>> <H3> </H3> <Ul> </Ul> Add links <Ul> <Li> This page <wd_idx<860>> was last edited on 4 October 2017 , at 02 <wd_idx<870>> : 00 . </Li> <Li> </Li> </Ul> <Ul> <Li> </Li> <wd_idx<880>> <Li> About Wikipedia </Li> <Li> </Li> <Li> </Li> <Li> </Li> <wd_idx<890>> <Li> </Li> <Li> </Li> <Li> </Li> </Ul> <Ul> <Li> </Li> <wd_idx<900>> <Li> </Li> </Ul>']\n",
