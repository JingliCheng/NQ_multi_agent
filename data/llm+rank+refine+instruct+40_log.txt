Top candidate ID: 22
================================
Attempt 1/1 
Raw response from LLM: Question: What features of muscle contraction can be determined from an emg (electromyogram)

Candidates:
- Content: "would result in enhanced validity of the study and potentially eradicate the contradictions within the research ."
- Content: "The following changes in the EMG signal can signify muscle fatigue : an increase in the mean absolute value of the signal , increase in the amplitude and duration of the muscle action potential and an overall shift to lower frequencies . Monitoring the changes of different frequency changes the most common way of using EMG to determine levels of fatigue . The lower conduction velocities enable the slower motor neurons to remain active ."
- Content: "Notably MUAP size and shape depend on where the electrode is located with respect to the fibers and so can appear to be different if the electrode moves position . EMG decomposition is non-trivial , although many methods have been proposed ."
- Content: "Rectification is the translation of the raw EMG signal to a signal with a single polarity , usually positive . The purpose of rectifying the signal is to ensure the signal does not average to zero , due to the raw EMG signal having positive and negative components . Two types of rectification are used : full - wave and half - wave rectification . Full - wave rectification adds the EMG signal below the baseline to the signal above the baseline to make a conditioned signal that is all positive . If the baseline is zero , this is equivalent to taking the absolute value of the signal . This is the preferred method of rectification because it conserves all of the signal energy,"
- Content: "typically similar . Notably MUAP size and shape depend on where the electrode is located with respect to the fibers and so can appear to be different if the electrode moves position . EMG decomposition is non-trivial , although many methods have been proposed ."

Reasoning: The best candidate for answering this question is ID 2 because it directly mentions that "The following changes in the EMG signal can signify muscle fatigue : an increase in the mean absolute value of the signal , increase in the amplitude and duration of the muscle action potential and an overall shift to lower frequencies ." This statement clearly explains how EMG signals can be used to determine levels of fatigue, making it the most relevant candidate.

This typically involves simply cleaning the skin with an alcohol pad . </P> <P> The actual placement of the needle electrode can be difficult and depends on a number of factors , such as specific muscle selection and the size of that muscle . Proper needle EMG placement is very important for accurate representation of the muscle of interest , although EMG is more effective on superficial muscles as it is unable to bypass the action potentials of superficial muscles and detect deeper muscles

Reasoning:
ID 3 is the best candidate because it provides a detailed explanation of the historical events that occurred after the fall of Western Rome, including the settlement of 418, the rise and fall of various warlords, and the eventual decline of the empire. While ID 4's content is similar to ID 3's, it only mentions the final emperors and puppets of the warlords, lacking the broader context provided by ID 3.

Reasoning:
ID 5 provides a general overview of Edward Gibbon's work "The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire" but does not directly address what happened to Western Rome after it fell. Its content is more focused on the historical approach to understanding the fall of the empire rather than providing specific information about its aftermath.

Raw response from LLM: Question: what happened to western rome after it fell
- Content: the forces of both Riothamus and Anthemius , and with the Burgundians took over almost all of the remaining imperial territory in southern Gaul . 
- Content: Ricimer then quarreled with Anthemius , and besieged him in Rome , which surrendered in July 472 after more months of starvation . 
- Content: Anthemius was captured and executed ( on Ricimer 's orders ) by the Burgundian prince Gundobad . 
- Content: In August Ricimer died of a pulmonary haemorrhage . 
- Content: Olybrius , his new emperor , named Gundobad as his patrician , then died himself shortly thereafter . 
- Content: After the death of Olybrius there was a further interregnum until March 473 , when Gundobad proclaimed Glycerius emperor . 
- Content: He may have made some attempt to intervene in Gaul ; if so , it was unsuccessful . 
- Content: Tremissis of Julius Nepos 
- Content: In 474 Julius Nepos , nephew and successor of the general Marcellinus , arrived in Rome with soldiers and authority from the eastern emperor Leo I. Gundobad had already left to contest the Burgundian throne in Gaul and Glycerius gave up without a fight , retiring to become bishop of Salona in Dalmatia . 
- Content: In 475 , Orestes , a former secretary of Attila , drove Julius Nepos out of Ravenna, 
- Content: rump states continued under some form of Roman rule after 476 . 
- Content: Julius Nepos still claimed to be Emperor of the West and controlled Dalmatia until his murder in 480 . 
- Content: Syagrius son of Aegidius ruled the Domain of Soissons until his murder in 487 . 
- Content: The indigenous inhabitants of Mauretania developed kingdoms of their own , independent of the Vandals , with strong Roman traits . They again sought Imperial recognition with the reconquests of Justinian I , and they put up effective resistance to the Muslim conquest of the Maghreb . 
- Content: While the civitates of Britannia sank into a level of material development inferior even to their pre-Roman Iron Age ancestors , they maintained identifiably Roman traits for some time , and they continued to look to their own defence as Honorius had authorized . 
- Content: The Ostrogothic Kingdom , which rose from the ruins of the Western Roman Empire 

Based on this question, I would rank candidates based on how likely their content is to answer the question. Here's my ranking:

1. ID: 39 - This candidate provides a clear and concise summary of the events that occurred after the fall of the Western Roman Empire.

2. ID: 40 - Although not directly answering the question, this candidate provides relevant information about the Ostrogothic Kingdom, which rose from the ruins of the Western Roman Empire.

3. The other candidates do not provide direct or clear answers to the question and are therefore ranked lower.

Based on my ranking, I would choose ID: 39 as the top candidate because it directly addresses the question and provides a clear summary of the events that occurred after the fall of the Western Roman Empire.

- Content: in Burdigala , declared himself Emperor . He moved on Rome with Visigothic support which gained his acceptance by Majorian and Ricimer , commanders of the remaining army of Italy . This was the first time that a barbarian kingdom had played a key role in the imperial succession . Avitus 's son - in - law Sidonius wrote propaganda to present the Visigothic king Theoderic II as a reasonable man with whom a Roman regime could do business . Theoderic 's payoff included precious metal from stripping the remaining public ornaments of Italy , and an unsupervised campaign in Hispania . There he not only defeated the Sueves , executing his brother - in - law Rechiar , but he also plundered Roman cities . The Burgundians expanded their kingdom in the Rhone valley and the Vandals took the remains of the Diocese of Africa . In 456 the Visigothic army was too heavily engaged in Hispania to be an effective threat to Italy , and Ricimer had just destroyed a pirate fleet of sixty Vandal ships ; Majorian and Ricimer marched against Avitus and defeated him near Placentia, ID: 36
- Content: he was never acknowledged by the East whose help Ricimer needed , and he died conveniently in 465 .

- Content: Diocese of Africa . Marcellinus rapidly drove the Vandals from Sardinia and Sicily , and a land invasion evicted them from Tripolitania . The commander in chief with the main force defeated a Vandal fleet near Sicily and landed at Cape Bon . Here Genseric offered to surrender , if he could have a five - day truce to prepare the process . He used the respite to prepare a full - scale attack preceded by fireships , which destroyed most of the Roman fleet and killed many of its soldiers . The Vandals were confirmed in their possession of the Diocese of Africa and they retook Sardinia and Sicily, ID: 38

Attempt 1/1 
Raw response from LLM: Question: when did athens emerged as wealthiest greek city state
- Content: Age , it had a wide range of economic interests and was something of a trade hub , exporting many items to mainland Greece as well as the Egyptian Empire of the period . The Minoans were also innovators , developing ( or adopting ) a system of lead weights to facilitate economic transactions . Despite this Minoan civilization remained , for the most part , an agriculturally driven one . 
- Content: political turmoil around 600 BCE It is believed that tenant farmers were paying rent equivalent to a sixth of their production , hence they were known as `` sixth - parters . '' Those who could not pay their rent could be sold by the landlord into slavery . In 594 Solon ( one of the great reformers of Athens ) would order the cancellation of debt and the freeing of those sold into slavery , a proclamation known as the `` Seisactheia . ''
- Content: . In the Greek homeland , established forms of agriculture continued . In most areas , free citizens farmed with the help of a slave or two , while other traditional forms of dependent labor also persisted -- helots in Sparta , serfs in Crete . Changes did occur in the pattern of land tenure , with land being accumulated by the wealthy at the expense of marginal farmers .
- Content: Pergamum, ID: 8

Based on the provided candidates, I would rank them as follows:

1. ID: 7
2. ID: 6
3. ID: 8

My reasoning is that candidate 7 provides a clear historical context and a specific date (594 BCE) when Athens emerged as a wealthy city-state due to Solon's reforms. Candidate 6 also provides relevant information about the economic situation in ancient Greece, but it does not directly mention Athens. Candidate 8, Pergamum, is mentioned after the Athenian period, so it is less relevant to the question.

Therefore, my final answer is:

{
    "reasoning": "ID 7 is the best candidate because it provides a clear historical context and a specific date when Athens emerged as a wealthy city-state.",

Top1 long answer            : . Attempts by John Komnenus to revert these trade agreements led to Venetian naval action and the Byzantines forced to reinstate the trade agreements that were favorable to the Venetians . </P> <H3> Later ( edit ) </H3> <P> After Constantinople was sacked in 1204 the city continued to bring in trade albeit with fewer gains for Byzantium . The trouble the Byzantines had was that they needed the Italian fleet to assist them in wars where troops and ships were few . The Byzantines attempted to prevent the Venetians from achieving complete economic supremacy by aiding their opponents in Milan and Genoa . </P> <H2> Ottoman Greece ( edit ) </H2> <P> During the period of Ottoman rule ,

- Content: surrounding axons . While these tracts exist for both efferent and afferent nerves , efferent nerves will carry signals down the spinal cord toward their effector target . These tracts also serve as the place of origin for lower motor neurons . There are seven major white matter motor tracts to be found in the spinal cord and are listed below : </P> <Ul> <Li> Lateral Corticospinal Tract </Li> <Li> Rubrospinal Tract </Li> <Li> Lateral Reticulospinal Tract </Li> <Li> Vestibulospinal tract </Li> <Li> Medial Reticulospinal Tract </Li> <Li> Tectospinal Tract </Li> <Li> Anterior Corticospinal Tract </Li> </Ul> <H3> Lower motor neurons ( edit ) </H3> <P> Lower motor neurons are, ID: 1
- Content: amounts of energy but are very resistant to fatigue , so they are used to sustain muscular contraction , such as keeping the body upright . They gain their energy via oxidative means and hence require oxygen . They are also called red fibers . </Li> <Li> Fast fatiguing ( FF ) motor units stimulate larger muscle groups , which apply large amounts of force but fatigue very quickly . They are used for tasks that require large brief bursts on energy , such as jumping or running . They gain their energy via glycolytic means and hence do n't require oxygen . They are called white fibers . </Li> <Li> Fast fatigue - resistant motor units stimulate moderate - sized muscles groups that do n't react as fast as, ID: 2
- Content: amounts of energy but are very resistant to fatigue , so they are used to sustain muscular contraction , such as keeping the body upright . They gain their energy via oxidative means and hence require oxygen . </Li>

The best candidate is ID: 1 because it directly explains what lower motor neurons are, which are "amounts of energy but are very resistant to fatigue", making them suitable for sustaining muscular contraction.

Raw response from LLM: Question: all the motor neurons that control the skeletal muscles are
Candidates:
- Content: on energy , such as jumping or running . They gain their energy via glycolytic means and hence do n't require oxygen . They are called white fibers .
- Content: Fast fatigue - resistant motor units stimulate moderate - sized muscles groups that do n't react as fast as the FF motor units , but can be sustained much longer ( as implied by the name ) and provide more force than S motor units . These use both oxidative and glycolytic means to gain energy .
- Content: In addition to voluntary skeletal muscle contraction , alpha motor neurons also contribute to muscle tone , the continuous force generated by noncontracting muscle to oppose stretching . When a muscle is stretched , sensory neurons within, 
- Content: the FF motor units , but can be sustained much longer ( as implied by the name ) and provide more force than S motor units . These use both oxidative and glycolytic means to gain energy .
- Content: In addition to voluntary skeletal muscle contraction , alpha motor neurons also contribute to muscle tone , the continuous force generated by noncontracting muscle to oppose stretching . When a muscle is stretched , sensory neurons within the muscle spindle detect the degree of stretch and send a signal to the CNS . The CNS activates alpha motor neurons in the spinal cord , which cause extrafusal muscle fibers to contract and thereby resist further stretching .
- Content: Beta motor neurons innervate intrafusal muscle fibers of muscle spindles , with collaterals to extrafusal fibres . There are two types of beta motor neurons : Slow Contracting - These innervate extrafusal fibers . Fast Contracting - These innervate intrafusal fibers .
- Content: Gamma motor neurons innervate intrafusal muscle fibers found within the muscle spindle . They regulate the sensitivity of the spindle to muscle stretching . With activation of gamma neurons , intrafusal muscle fibers contract,

Ranking:
1. ID 4 is the best candidate because it directly states that alpha motor neurons control skeletal muscles and contribute to muscle tone.

Reasoning: The other candidates provide information related to motor units, energy sources, and sensory neurons, but they do not directly state that alpha motor neurons control skeletal muscles.

================================
Attempt 1/1 
Raw response from LLM: Question: Calpurnia's son's name in To Kill a Mockingbird
Candidates:
- Content: only one of the novel's primary three children (Dill, Jem, and herself) to see and speak to Boo Radley during the course of the novel and realize that he is harmless, despite her initial fear of him. She also stops a mob that is trying to lynch Tom Robinson by talking to the mob leader, Mr. Cunningham, about inviting his son, Walter, over for dinner. Mr. Cunningham then tells the other mob members to get back in their cars and leave them alone. The members listen, and Scout unintentionally saves Tom Robinson's life. She is portrayed by Mary Badham in the film adaptation of To Kill a Mockingbird. Notable quote: "Until I feared I would lose it, I never loved to read. One does not love breathing." <P> Notable quote: ''Jem'' Finch (edit, ID: 1
- Content: Scout for love and friendship, such as leaving them small gifts and figures in a tree knothole. Scout finally meets him at the very end of the book, when he saves the children's lives from Bob Ewell. Scout describes him as being sickly white, with a thin mouth, thin and feathery hair, and grey eyes, almost as if he were blind. During the same night, when Boo whispers to Scout to walk him back to the Radley house, Scout takes a moment to picture what it would be like to be Boo Radley. While standing on his porch, she realizes his "exile" inside his house is really not that lonely. <P> Boo Radley's heroics in protecting the children from Bob Ewell are covered up by Atticus, Sheriff Tate, and Scout. This can be read as a wise refusal of fame. As Tate notes, if word got out that Boo killed Ewell, Boo would be inundated, ID: 3
- Content: Cunningham, Sr. (edit) <H3> Walter Cunningham, Sr. is Walter Cunningham Jr.'s father. He appears only twice, once at the beginning of the story when he has to pay off the debt to Atticus (Walter Cunningham Sr. was his client) by giving him firewood, vegetables and other supplies. He also leads the mob that comes to lynch Tom Robinson the night before the trial. Only when Scout talks to him about his son and how much he owes to Atticus does he reconsider and call off the mob. Scout innocently shames him because Scout reminds him of, ID: 9

Based on the provided candidates, I have ranked them as follows:

Attempt 1/1 
Raw response from LLM: Question: what is the center of heredity in a cell
- Content: The nucleolus is a discrete densely stained structure found in the nucleus. It forms around tandem repeats of rDNA, DNA coding for ribosomal RNA (rRNA). The main roles of the nucleolus are to synthesize rRNA and assemble ribosomes.

- Content: Rafa and PTF domains

- Content: Promyelocytic leukaemia bodies (PML bodies)

The top candidate is ID 3 because their content directly mentions "nucleolus" which is a structure that plays a crucial role in the synthesis of rRNA, a key component of ribosomes. The nucleolus is indeed considered the center of heredity in a cell as it is responsible for the assembly of ribosomes, which are essential for protein synthesis and cellular function.

================================
Attempt 1/1 
Raw response from LLM: Question: what is the center of heredity in a cell
- Content: transcription so the protein components instead form a perinucleolar cap . 
- Content: The nuclear envelope acts as a barrier that prevents both DNA and RNA viruses from entering the nucleus . Some viruses require access to proteins inside the nucleus in order to replicate and / or assemble . DNA viruses , such as herpesvirus replicate and assemble in the cell nucleus , and exit by budding through the inner nuclear membrane . This process is accompanied by disassembly of the lamina on the nuclear face of the inner membrane .
- Content: assembly itself is an inducer of apoptosis .

The best candidate is ID 11 because it directly mentions "nucleus" which is a key term related to heredity in cells.

Raw response from LLM: Question: what land mass was north america a part of about 300 million years ago
Candidates:
- Content: split into three pieces : the supercontinent of Proto - Laurasia , the supercontinent of Proto - Gondwana , and the smaller Congo craton . Proto - Laurasia and Proto - Gondwana were separated by the Proto - Tethys Ocean . Next Proto - Laurasia itself split apart to form the continents of Laurentia , Siberia and Baltica . Baltica moved to the east of Laurentia , and Siberia moved northeast of Laurentia . The splitting also created two new oceans , the Iapetus Ocean and Paleoasian Ocean . Most of the above masses coalesced again to form the relatively short - lived supercontinent of Pannotia . This supercontinent included large amounts of land near the poles and , near the equator , only a relatively small strip connecting the, ID: 0
- Content: by the end of the Ordovician to form a minor supercontinent called Euramerica or Laurussia , closing the Iapetus Ocean . The collision also resulted in the formation of the northern Appalachians . Siberia sat near Euramerica , with the Khanty Ocean between the two continents . While all this was happening , Gondwana drifted slowly towards the South Pole . This was the first step of the formation of Pangaea .
- Content: is identical for all samples , and can be removed , leaving geologists with the portion of this motion that shows continental drift and can be used to help reconstruct earlier continental positions .
- Content: There were three major phases in the break - up of Pangaea . The first phase began in the Early - Middle Jurassic ( about 175 Ma ) ,, ID: 2

Reasoning: ID 0 is the best candidate because its content provides a detailed explanation of the supercontinent of Proto-Laurasia and how it split apart to form the continents of Laurentia, Siberia, and Baltica. This information directly addresses the question of what land mass North America was part of about 300 million years ago.

- Content: adapt and thrive in warmer and tropical climate . Because we would not assume that the plant fossils were capable of traveling to a different place we suspect that Svalbard possibly had a warmer , less frigid climate in the past . </P> <P> When Pangaea separated , the reorganization of the continents changed the function of the oceans and seaways . The restructuring of the continents , changed and altered the distribution of warmth and coolness of the oceans . When North America and South America connected , it stopped equatorial currents from passing from the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific Ocean . Researchers have found evidence by using computer hydrological models to show that this strengthened the Gulf Stream by diverting more warm currents towards Europe . Warm waters at high latitudes led to an increased evaporation and, ID: 3
- Content: lysocline shrinking , there were fewer places for calcite to dissolve in the ocean , considering calcite only dissolves at deep ocean depths . This led to the extinction of carbonate producers such as brachiopods and corals that relied on dissolved calcite to survive . The second source is the eruption of the Siberian Traps , a large volcanic event which is argued to be the result of Pangaean tectonic movement . This had several negative repercussions on the environment , including metal loading and excess atmospheric carbon . Metal loading , the release of toxic metals from volcanic eruptions into the environment , led to acid rain and general stress on the environment . These toxic metals are known, ID: 4

Based on the provided content, I would rank candidate ID: 3 as the top choice because their content mentions Pangaea, which is a land mass that included North America about 300 million years ago. The reasoning for this choice is:

"ID 3 is the best candidate because it provides information about Pangaea, which is directly related to the question asked."

The final answer is:

4. ID 6 (Content: Madonna) - Similar to ID 5, this candidate is mentioned in the list of top-selling artists but does not provide a direct answer to the question.
5. ID 7 (Content: Elton John) - This candidate is also part of the list of top-selling artists but does not directly address the question.
6. ID 8 (Content: Led Zeppelin) - Like IDs 5, 6, and 7, this candidate provides no direct answer to the question.
7. ID 9 (Content: Pink Floyd) - This candidate also does not provide a direct answer to the question.

Therefore, my reasoning is that ID 3 (The Beatles) is the best candidate because it directly answers the question about which band sold the most records.

Attempt 1/1 
Raw response from LLM: Question: when was the first australian prime minister elected
Candidates:
- Content: The conventions of the Westminster system were thought to be sufficiently entrenched in Australia by the authors of the Constitution that it was deemed unnecessary to detail them . The formal title of the portfolio has always been simply `` Prime Minister '' , except for the period of the Fourth Deakin Ministry ( June 1909 to April 1910 ) , when it was known as `` Prime Minister ( without portfolio ) '' .
- Content: Prime Minister , although the Country Party was the smaller of the two coalition parties . The government depended on support from two independents , who two months later voted against Fadden 's budget and brought the government down , paving the way for John Curtin to be appointed as Labor Prime Minister .
- Content: of them have survived longer than 30 years ( Hughes lived for 29 years and 8 months following service ) . Bob Hawke , who is , as of 2017 , still alive , has also lived 25 years beyond the end of his prime ministership .
- Content: The longest - surviving was Gough Whitlam , who lived 38 years and 11 months after office , surpassing Stanley Bruce 's previous record of 37 years and 10 months after leaving the office .

The best candidate is ID: 5 because it provides information about the ages of Australian prime ministers, which indirectly answers the question about when the first Australian prime minister was elected.

Based on the provided content, I would choose candidate ID: 6 (Sir Robert Menzies) as the top candidate. The reasoning is that he served in office twice and was the longest-serving Prime Minister of Australia, indicating his significance in Australian history.

- Content: ( 1890 -- 1983 ) 
- Content: 13 July 1945 
- Content: 19 December 1949 
- Content: 24 June 

Reasoning: The best candidate is ID 9 because it directly mentions the date of Frank Forde's death, which is closely related to his term as Prime Minister. Although it does not explicitly state that he was the first Australian Prime Minister, the context suggests that he was, given that he took office after Curtin's death and before Chifley's term began.
