The most common way that can be determined is by performing a maximal voluntary contraction ( MVC ) of the muscle that is being tested . </P> <P> Muscle force , which is measured mechanically , typically correlates highly with measures of EMG activation of muscle . Most commonly this is assessed with surface electrodes , but it should be recognized that these typically only record from muscle fibers in close approximation to the surface . </P> <P> Several analytical methods for determining muscle activation are commonly used depending on the application .

Top1 long answer            : at least the time of Henri Pirenne scholars have described a continuity of Roman culture and political legitimacy long after 476 . Pirenne postponed the demise of classical civilization to the 8th century . He challenged the notion that Germanic barbarians had caused the Western Roman Empire to end , and he refused to equate the end of the Western Roman Empire with the end of the office of emperor in Italy . He pointed out the essential continuity of the economy of the Roman Mediterranean even after the barbarian invasions , and suggested that only the Muslim conquests represented a decisive break with antiquity . The more recent formulation of a historical period characterized as `` Late Antiquity '' emphasizes the transformations of ancient to medieval worlds within a cultural continuity . In recent decades archaeologically - based argument even extends the continuity in material culture and in patterns of settlement as late as the eleventh century . Observing the political reality of lost control , but also the cultural and archaeological continuities , the process has been described as a complex cultural transformation , rather than a fall . </P> <H2> Height of power , crises , and recoveries ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Height of power ( edit ) </H3> <P> The Roman Empire reached its greatest geographical extent under Trajan ( emperor 98 -- 117 ) , who ruled a prosperous state that stretched from Armenia

Top1 long answer            : axons from the lower motor neurons are efferent nerve fibers that carry signals from the spinal cord to the effectors . Types of lower motor neurons are alpha motor neurons , beta motor neurons , and gamma motor neurons . </P> <P> The term ' motor neuron ' is usually restricted to the lower motor neurons , the efferent nerves that directly innervate muscles . </P> <P> A single motor neuron may innervate many muscle fibres and a muscle fibre can undergo many action potentials in the time taken for a single muscle twitch . As a result , if an action potential arrives before a twitch has completed ,
Short answer                : lower motor neurons
