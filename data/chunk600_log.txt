In early 1776 , Thomas Paine argued in the closing pages of the first edition of Common Sense that the `` custom of nations '' demanded a formal declaration of American independence if any European power were to mediate a peace between the Americans and Great Britain . The monarchies of France and Spain in particular could not be expected to aid those they considered rebels against another legitimate

Top1 long answer            : PORC ) . </P> <P> Except in the case of some purely primary myopathic conditions EMG is usually performed with another electrodiagnostic medicine test that measures the conducting function of nerves . This is called a nerve conduction studies ( NCS ) . Needle EMG and NCSs are typically indicated when there is pain in the limbs , weakness from spinal nerve compression , or concern about some other neurologic injury or disorder . Spinal nerve injury does not cause neck , mid back pain or low back pain , and for this reason , evidence has not shown EMG or NCS to be helpful in diagnosing causes of axial lumbar pain , thoracic pain , or cervical spine pain . Needle EMG may aid with the diagnosis of nerve compression or injury ( such as carpal tunnel syndrome ) , nerve root injury ( such as sciatica ) , and with other problems of the muscles or nerves . Less common medical conditions include amyotrophic lateral sclerosis , myasthenia gravis , and muscular dystrophy . </P> <H2> Technique ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Skin preparation and risks ( edit ) </H3> <P> The first step before insertion of the needle electrode is skin preparation . This typically involves simply cleaning the skin with an alcohol pad . </P> <P> The actual placement of the needle electrode can be difficult and depends on a number of factors , such as specific muscle selection and the size of that muscle . Proper needle EMG placement is very important for accurate representation of the muscle of interest , although EMG is more effective on superficial muscles as it is unable to bypass the action potentials of superficial muscles and detect deeper muscles . Also , the more body fat an individual has , the weaker the EMG signal . When placing the EMG sensor , the ideal location is at the belly of the muscle : the longitudinal midline . The belly

Alaric was disappointed in his hopes for promotion to magister militum after the battle of the Frigidus . He again led Gothic tribesmen in arms and established himself as an independent power , burning the countryside as far as the walls of Constantinople . Alaric 's ambitions for long - term Roman office were never quite acceptable to the Roman imperial courts , and his men could never settle long enough to farm in any one area . They showed no inclination to leave the Empire and face the Huns from whom they had fled in 376 ; indeed the Huns were still stirring up further migrations which often ended by attacking Rome in turn . Alaric 's group was never destroyed nor expelled from the Empire , nor acculturated under effective Roman domination .

- Content: within the walls . It was ended by a payment that , though large , was less than one of the richest senators could have produced . The super-rich aristocrats made little contribution ; pagan temples were stripped of ornaments to make up the total . With promises of freedom , Alaric also recruited many of the slaves in Rome .

- Content: women in Ancient Rome did not exercise military power and she could not herself become a general . She tried for some years to avoid reliance on a single dominant military figure , maintaining a balance of power between her three senior officers , Aetius ( magister militum in Gaul ) , Count Boniface governor in the Diocese of Africa , and Flavius Felix magister militum praesentalis in Italy . Meanwhile , the Empire deteriorated seriously . Apart from the losses in the Diocese of Africa , Hispania was slipping out of central control and into the hands of local rulers and Suevic bandits . In Gaul the Rhine frontier had collapsed , the Visigoths in Aquitaine may have launched,
- Content: temporarily retired to his estates , but after an attempt to murder him he raised another Hunnic army ( probably by conceding parts of Pannonia to them ) and in 433 he returned to Italy , overcoming all rivals . He never threatened to become an Augustus himself and thus maintained the support of the Eastern court , where Valentinian 's cousin Theodosius II reigned until 450 .
- Content: Aetius campaigned vigorously , somewhat stabilizing the situation in Gaul and in Hispania . He relied heavily on his forces of Huns . With a ferocity celebrated centuries later in the Nibelungenlied , the Huns slaughtered many Burgundians on the middle Rhine , re-establishing the survivors as Roman allies , the first Kingdom of the Burgundians . This may have returned some sort of Roman authority to Trier . Eastern troops reinforced Carthage , temporarily halting the Vandals , who in 435 agreed to limit themselves to Numidia and leave the most fertile parts of North Africa in peace . Aetius concentrated his limited military resources to defeat the Visigoths again , and his diplomacy restored a degree of order to Hispania . However , his general Litorius was badly defeated by the Visigoths at Toulouse , and a new Suevic king , Rechiar , began vigorous assaults on what remained of Roman Hispania . At one point Rechiar even allied with Bagaudae . These were Romans not under imperial control ; some of their reasons for rebellion may be indicated by the remarks of a Roman captive under Attila who was happy in his lot , giving a lively account of ,

ID 9 is the best candidate because it provides a detailed account of Constantine III's rise to power and his control over Gaul and beyond, as well as Gerontius' efforts to settle the Sueves and Asding Vandals in Hispania.

ID 12 is a close second because it highlights the instability and power struggles that followed Honorius' death, including the capture and execution of Joannes, which had significant consequences for the Western Roman Empire.

ID 15 is the weakest candidate because its content focuses on the decline of the Western Roman Empire in Gaul, without providing a clear narrative about what happened to Western Rome after it fell.

Top1 long answer            : . They first requested leave from the Emperor to lay aside the cuirass and afterwards the helmet . In consequence of this , our troops in their engagements with the Goths were often overwhelmed with their showers of arrows . Nor was the necessity of obliging the infantry to resume their cuirasses and helmets discovered , notwithstanding such repeated defeats , which brought on the destruction of so many great cities . Troops , defenseless and exposed to all the weapons of the enemy , are more disposed to fly than fight . What can be expected from a foot - archer without cuirass or helmet , who can not hold at once his bow and shield ; or from the ensigns whose bodies are naked , and who can not at the same time carry a shield and the colors ? The foot soldier finds the weight of a cuirass and even of a helmet intolerable . This is because he is so seldom exercised and rarely puts them on . </P> <P> The final Gothic settlement was acclaimed with relief , even the official panegyrist admitting that these Goths could not be expelled or exterminated , nor reduced to unfree status . Instead they were either recruited into the imperial forces , or settled in the devastated provinces along the south bank of the Danube , where the regular garrisons were never fully re-established .

- Content: . Deflation occurred after this dichotomization of the drachma , as well as a rise in interest rates . These policies had the effect of causing much of the populace to lose faith in their government , and investment decreased as people began to stop holding their assets in cash which had become unstable , and began holding real goods . </P> Great Depression ( edit ) <P> As the reverberations of the Great Depression hit Greece in 1932 , the Bank of Greece tried to adopt deflationary policies to stave off the crises that were going on in other countries , but these largely failed . For a brief period the drachma was pegged to the US dollar , but this was unsustainable given the country 's large trade deficit and the only long - term effects of this were Greece 's foreign exchange reserves being almost totally wiped out in 1932 . Remittances from abroad declined sharply and the value of the drachma began to plummet from 77 drachmas to the dollar in March 1931 to 111 drachmas to the dollar in April , 1931 . This was especially harmful to Greece as the country relied on imports from the UK , France and the Middle East for many necessities . Greece went off the gold standard in April , 1932 and declared a moratorium on all interest payments . The country also adopted protectionist policies such as import quotas , which a number of European countries did during the time period . </P> <P> Protectionist policies coupled with a weak drachma , stifling imports , allowed Greek industry to expand during the Great Depression . In 1939 Greek Industrial output was 179 % that of 1928 ., ID: 2

Top1 long answer            : eventually play a role in the maturation of motor activity . This is how muscle relaxants work by acting on the motor neurons that innervate muscles ( by decreasing their electrophysiological activity ) or on cholinergic neuromuscular junctions , rather than on the muscles themselves . </Li> </Ul> <H3> Special visceral motor neurons ( edit ) </H3> <P> These are also known as branchial motor neurons , which are involved in facial expression , mastication , phonation , and swallowing .

Raw response from LLM: Question: what is the center of heredity in a cell
Candidates:
- Content: trafficked into the nucleus . There they serve as transcription factors when bound to their ligand ; in the absence of a ligand , many such receptors function as histone deacetylases that repress gene expression . ID: 1
- Content: The compartmentalization allows the cell to prevent translation of unspliced mRNA . Eukaryotic mRNA contains introns that must be removed before being translated to produce functional proteins . The splicing is done inside the nucleus before the mRNA can be accessed by ribosomes for translation . Without the nucleus , ribosomes would translate newly transcribed ( unprocessed ) mRNA , resulting in malformed and nonfunctional proteins . ID: 7
- Content: similar endosymbiotic relationship between proto - eukaryotes and aerobic bacteria . The archaeal origin of the nucleus is supported by observations that archaea and eukarya have similar genes for certain proteins , including histones . Observations that myxobacteria are motile , can form multicellular complexes , and possess kinases and G proteins similar to eukarya , support a bacterial origin for the eukaryotic cell . ID: 10

There they serve as transcription factors when bound to their ligand ; in the absence of a ligand , many such receptors function as histone deacetylases that repress gene expression . </P> <H3> Nuclear lamina </H3> Main article : Nuclear lamina <P> In animal cells , two networks of intermediate filaments provide the nucleus with mechanical support : The nuclear lamina forms an organized meshwork on the internal face of the envelope , while less organized support is provided on the cytosolic face of the envelope . Both systems provide structural support for the nuclear envelope and anchoring sites for chromosomes and nuclear pores . </P> <P> The nuclear lamina is composed mostly of lamin proteins . Like all proteins , lamins are synthesized in the cytoplasm and later transported to the nucleus interior , where they are assembled before being incorporated into the existing

- Content: individual city - states . These subgroups can be described as denominations . Hellenic religion , and Hellenic polytheism can be said to be used interchangeably to refer to the religion , and are synonymous . The phrase Hellenic Polytheistic Reconstructionism refers more to the methodology used by some practitioners to revive a version of the religion , than the religion itself . Not all Hellenic Polytheists are reconstructionists . Dodekatheism and Olympianism are other names , though less commonly used .

Given this content, I choose candidate ID: 3 as the top candidate because their content mentions "Hellenic polytheistic religion" which is a term that refers to the belief in Greek gods. The language used is formal and academic, suggesting a high level of knowledge about the subject matter.

Candidates:
- Content: inspired by ancient Greek virtues such as reciprocity , hospitality , self - control and moderation . The Delphic maxims , Tenets of Solon , the Golden Verses of Pythagoras , or even Aristotle 's Ethics each function as complete moral codes that a Hellenic Polytheist may observe . Key to most ethical systems is the idea of kharis ( or `` charis '' , grace ) , to establish reciprocity between humanity and the gods , between individuals , and among community members . Another key value in Hellenic Polytheism is eusebeia , often translated as piety . This implies a commitment to the worship of the Hellenic gods and action to back this up . Individual worshipers are generally expected to perform their own rituals,

Given the options, none of them seem to be directly related to the general belief in Greek gods. However, some figures from Greek mythology are mentioned, such as Cassandra, Mopsus, and Polyeidos, who were believed to have prophetic or supernatural abilities.

Based on this analysis, I would say that ID: 5 (Ennomus) is the closest match, but it's still not a direct answer. If I had to choose one, I would say that ID: 12 (Mopsus) is the most relevant option, as Mopsus was a seer and prophet in Greek mythology.

However, please note that this analysis is based on limited information and may not be exhaustive. A more thorough examination of the options might reveal other connections or nuances that are not immediately apparent.

This supercontinent included large amounts of land near the poles and, near the equator, only a relatively small strip connecting the polar masses. Pannotia lasted until 540 Ma, near the beginning of the Cambrian period and then broke up, giving rise to the continents of Laurentia, Baltica, and the southern supercontinent of Gondwana.", ID: 1

Based on the provided candidates, I have ranked them based on how likely their content is to answer the question. The ranking is as follows:

1. ID: 5 - This candidate provides a list of resources related to Australian Prime Ministers, which may include information about the first Australian Prime Minister.
2. ID: 4 - This candidate's content includes a section on "Library resources about Prime Minister of Australia", which could potentially provide information about the first Australian Prime Minister.

Attempt 1/1 
Raw response from LLM: Question: host of the late show who was once a correspondent for the daily show
Candidates:
- Content: Contributors 
- Content: Campaign Correspondent. Segment Host: `` What The Actual Fact ? ''
- Content: Stewart's stewardship of Colbert SuperPAC in 2011. With a nearly nine-year tenure, Colbert was the longest serving correspondent on The Daily Show until his record was broken by Samantha Bee in 2011. Before taking over as new host of The Late Show on CBS, Colbert made his final appearance for Jon Stewart's last episode on August 6, 2015.
- Content: The younger brother of correspondent Rob Corddry.

Based on the provided content, I have ranked the candidates based on how likely their content is to answer the question. 

The top candidate is:
ID: 3
Reasoning: ID 3 is the best candidate because it directly mentions "Colbert", who is known for being a host of The Late Show and previously a correspondent for The Daily Show, making it a strong connection to the question.

Output:
{

Based on the provided content, I have ranked the candidates as follows:

1. ID: 6 - Bassem Youssef is a well-known comedian and correspondent who hosted The Daily Show with Jon Stewart before moving to The Late Show with Stephen Colbert.

2. ID: 3 - Frank DeCaro was a correspondent for The Daily Show and later became the host of his own program on Sirius Satellite Radio.

3. ID: 1 - Mick Foley is a comedian and correspondent who appeared on The Daily Show, but I couldn't find any information about him hosting The Late Show.

4. ID: 5 - Dave Gorman was a contributor to The Daily Show in 2001, but I couldn't find any information about him hosting The Late Show.

5. ID: 2 - Larry Wilmore was a correspondent for The Daily Show and later became the host of The Nightly Show with Larry Wilmore, but he is not known for hosting The Late Show.

6. ID: 4 - Michelle Wolf was a correspondent for The Daily Show, but I couldn't find any information about her hosting The Late Show.

Reasoning: Although all candidates have some connection to The Daily Show, Bassem Youssef's transition from The Daily Show to The Late Show makes him the most likely candidate to answer the question.

Top1 long answer            : microchipped so that each bird is uniquely identifiable . </P> <H2> Usage ( edit ) </H2> Information about the implant is often imprinted on a collar tag worn by a pet <P> Microchips can be implanted by a veterinarian or at a shelter . After checking that the animal does not already have a chip , the vet or technician injects the chip with a syringe and records the chip 's unique ID . No anesthetic is required it is a simple procedure and causes little discomfort : the pain is minimal and short - lived . A test scan ensures correct operation . </P> <P> An enrollment form is completed with chip ID , owner contact information , pet
