Top1 long answer            : relaxed muscle to evaluate both insertional activity and resting activity in the muscle . Normal muscles exhibit a brief burst of muscle fiber activation when stimulated by needle movement , but this rarely lasts more than 100ms . The two most common pathologic types of resting activity in muscle are fasciculation and fibrillation potentials . A fasciculation potential is an involuntary activation of a motor unit within the muscle , sometimes visible with the naked eye as a muscle twitch or by surface electrodes . Fibrillations , however , are only detected by needle EMG , and represent the isolated activation of individual muscle fibers , usually as the result of nerve or muscle disease . Often , fibrillations are triggered by needle movement ( insertional activity ) and persist for several seconds or more after the movement ceases . </P> <P> After assessing resting and insertional activity , the electromyographer assess the activity of muscle during voluntary contraction . The shape , size , and frequency of the resulting electrical signals are judged . Then the electrode is retracted a few millimetres , and again the activity is analyzed

Top1 long answer            : is a membrane - enclosed organelle found in eukaryotic cells . Eukaryotes usually have a single nucleus , but a few cell types , such as mammalian red blood cells , have no nuclei , and a few others have many . </P> <P> Cell nuclei contain most of the cell 's genetic material , organized as multiple long linear DNA molecules in complex with a large variety of proteins , such as histones , to form chromosomes . The genes within these chromosomes are the cell 's nuclear genome and are structured in such a way to promote cell function . The nucleus maintains the integrity of genes and controls the activities of the cell by regulating gene expression -- the nucleus is , therefore , the control center of the cell . The main structures making up the nucleus are the nuclear envelope , a double membrane that encloses the entire organelle and isolates its contents from the cellular cytoplasm , and the nuclear matrix ( which includes the nuclear lamina ) , a network within the nucleus

Top1 long answer            : radiologists pointed out that the radiodensity of the metal inside the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts was close to that of soft tissue , and the coins would therefore be difficult to detect in X-ray imaging . One aluminum cent was donated to the Smithsonian Institution . </P> <P> The cent 's composition was changed in 1982 because the value of the copper in the coin started to rise above one cent . Some 1982 pennies used the 97.5 % zinc composition , while others used the 95 % copper composition . With the exception of 2009 bicentennial cents minted specifically for collectors , United States cents minted after 1982 have been zinc with copper - plating . In Fiscal Year 2013 , the average one - cent piece minted cost the U.S. Mint 1.83 cents , down from 2.41 cents apiece in FY 2011 . </P> <P> The bronze and copper cents can be distinguished from the newer zinc cents
