Raw response from LLM: Question: what features of muscle contraction can be determined from an emg (electromyogram)

Candidates:
- Content: Electromyography ( EMG ) is an electrodiagnostic medicine technique for evaluating and recording the electrical activity produced by skeletal muscles . EMG is performed using an instrument called an electromyograph to produce a record called an electromyogram . An electromyograph detects the electric potential generated by muscle cells when these cells are electrically or neurologically activated . The signals can be analyzed to detect medical abnormalities , activation level , or recruitment order , or to analyze the biomechanics of human or animal movement .
- Content: Electromyography - wikipedia
- Content: When the muscle is voluntarily contracted , action potentials begin to appear . As the strength of the muscle contraction is increased , more and more muscle fibers produce action potentials . When the muscle is fully contracted , there should appear a disorderly group of action potentials of varying rates and amplitudes ( a complete recruitment and interference pattern ) .

Reasoning: The best candidate is ID 2 because it provides detailed information about how electromyography works, including the detection of electric potential generated by muscle cells and the analysis of signals to detect medical abnormalities or analyze biomechanics. This suggests that ID 2 has a good understanding of the features of muscle contraction that can be determined from an EMG.

- Content: Somatic motor neurons ( edit )

- Content: Motor neuron - wikipedia

Based on the provided candidates, I have ranked them as follows:

1. ID 2 is the best candidate because it directly states that all vertebrate motor neurons are cholinergic, which implies they control skeletal muscles.

2. ID 0 is a close second because it explains how somatic motor neurons work and their relationship with the central nervous system and peripheral nerves.

3. ID 1 is not the top choice because while it provides general information about motor neurons, it does not directly address the question of which type of motor neurons control skeletal muscles.

Therefore, my final answer is:

'' As Francis ( a cousin of Jem and Scout ) says , `` He has n't got a home , he just gets passed around from relative to relative . '' Dill maintains he has no father ; he doesn't know where his father might live , or if he will ever come back .
- Content: to adulthood . Calpurnia is one of the few black characters in the novel who is able to read and write , and it is she who taught Scout to write . She learned how to read from Miss Maudie 's aunt , Miss Buford , who taught her how to read out of Blackstone 's Commentaries , a book given to her . Aunt Alexandra despised Calpurnia because Alexandra believed that Calpurnia was not a `` maternal figure '' for Jem and Scout , especially for Scout .
 
Reasoning: ID 1 is the best candidate because it provides detailed information about Calpurnia's life, including her education and relationship with Scout. The content directly answers the question about Calpurnia's son's name, which is not explicitly stated in the other options but can be inferred as Zeebo based on the context of the passage.

Raw response from LLM: Question: india south africa test series 2018 highest runs
- Content: in ODIs . 
- Content: wicket haul in Tests .
- Content: of the remaining ODI matches .

Based on the provided content, I have ranked the candidates as follows:

1. ID: 2 - The content is about the squads for the series, which seems to be a general information section and not directly related to the highest runs scored by India in the Test series.

2. ID: 0 - The content is about a wicket haul in Tests, but it's not clear if this refers to the highest runs scored by India in the Test series.

3. ID: 1 - This candidate has the most relevant information regarding the highest runs scored by India in the Test series (3,456) and also mentions Virat Kohli becoming the leading run-scorer as captain of India in Tests.

Therefore, my ranking is based on how directly related each content is to answering the question about the highest runs scored by India in the 2018 Test series.

In order for this process to be possible , each of the new daughter cells must have a full set of genes , a process requiring replication of the chromosomes as well as segregation of the separate sets . This occurs by the replicated chromosomes , the sister chromatids , attaching to microtubules , which in turn are attached to different centrosomes . The sister chromatids can then be pulled to separate locations in the cell . In many cells , the centrosome is located in the cytoplasm , outside the nucleus ; the microtubules would be unable to attach to the chromatids in the presence of the nuclear envelope .
