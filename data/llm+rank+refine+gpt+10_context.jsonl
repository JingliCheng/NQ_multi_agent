It was approved , after much debate ( between July 1776 and November 1777 ) , by the Second Continental Congress on November 15 , 1777 , and sent to the states for ratification . The Articles of Confederation came into force on March 1 , 1781 , after being ratified by all 13 states . A guiding principle of the Articles was to preserve the independence and sovereignty of the states . The federal government received only those powers which the colonies had recognized as belonging to king and parliament . </P> <P> The Articles formed a war - time confederation of states , with an extremely limited central government . While unratified , the document was used by the Congress to conduct business , direct the American Revolutionary War , conduct diplomacy with foreign nations , and deal with territorial issues and Native American relations . The adoption of the Articles made few perceptible changes in the federal government , because it did little more than legalize what the Continental Congress had been doing . That body was renamed the Congress of the Confederation ; but Americans continued to call it the Continental Congress , since its organization remained the same . </P> <P> As the Confederation Congress attempted to govern the continually growing American states , delegates discovered that the limitations placed upon the central government rendered it ineffective at doing so . As the government 's weaknesses became apparent , especially after Shays ' Rebellion , individuals began asking for changes to the Articles . Their hope was to create a stronger national government . Initially , some states met to deal with their trade and economic problems . However , as more states became interested in meeting to change the Articles , a meeting was set in Philadelphia on May 25 , 1787 . This became the Constitutional Convention . It was quickly realized that changes would not work , and instead the entire Articles needed to be replaced . On March 4 , 1789 , the government under the Articles was replaced with the federal government under the Constitution . The new Constitution provided for a much stronger federal government by establishing a chief executive ( the President ) , courts , and taxing powers . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Background and context </Li> <Li> 2 Drafting </Li> <Li> 3 Ratification </Li> <Li> 4 Article summaries </Li> <Li> 5 Congress under the Articles <Ul> <Li> 5.1 The Army </Li> <Li> 5.2 Foreign policy </Li> <Li> 5.3 Taxation and commerce </Li> <Li> 5.4 Accomplishments </Li> <Li> 5.5 Presidents of Congress </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 6 The U.S. under the Articles </Li> <Li> 7 Signatures <Ul> <Li> 7.1 Signers </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 8 Gallery </Li> <Li> 9 Revision and replacement <Ul> <Li> 9.1 Legitimacy of closing down </Li> <Li> 9.2 Final months </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 10 See also </Li> <Li> 11 References </Li> <Li> 12 Further reading </Li> <Li> 13 External links </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> Background and Context </H2> <P> The political push to increase cooperation among the then - loyal colonies began with the Albany Congress in 1754 and Benjamin Franklin 's proposed Albany Plan , an inter-colonial collaboration to help solve mutual local problems . The Articles of Confederation would bear some resemblance to it . Over the next two decades , some of the basic concepts it addressed would strengthen and others would weaken , particularly the degree of deserved loyalty to the crown . With civil disobedience resulting in coercive , and what the colonials perceived as intolerable acts of Parliament , and armed conflict resulting in dissidents being proclaimed rebels and outside the King 's protection , any loyalty remaining shifted toward independence and how to achieve it . In 1775 , with events outpacing communications , the Second Continental Congress began acting as the provisional government that would run the American Revolutionary War and gain the colonies their collective independence . </P> <P> It was an era of constitution writing -- most states were busy at the task -- and leaders felt the new nation must have a written constitution , even though other nations did not . During the war , Congress exercised an unprecedented level of political , diplomatic , military and economic authority . It adopted trade restrictions , established and maintained an army , issued fiat money , created a military code and negotiated with foreign governments . </P> <P> To transform themselves from outlaws into a legitimate nation , the colonists needed international recognition for their cause and foreign allies to support it . In early 1776 , Thomas Paine argued in the closing pages of the first edition of Common Sense that the `` custom of nations '' demanded a formal declaration of American independence if any European power were to mediate a peace between the Americans and Great Britain . The monarchies of France and Spain in particular could not be expected to aid those they considered rebels against another legitimate monarch . Foreign courts needed to have American grievances laid before them persuasively in a `` manifesto '' which could also reassure them that the Americans would be reliable trading partners . Without such a declaration , Paine concluded , `` ( t ) he custom of all courts is against us , and will be so , until , by an independence , we take rank with other nations . '' </P> <P> Beyond improving their existing association , the records of the Second Continental Congress show that the need for a declaration of independence was intimately linked with the demands of international relations . On June 7 , 1776 , Richard Henry Lee introduced a resolution before the Continental Congress declaring the colonies independent ; at the same time he also urged Congress to resolve `` to take the most effectual measures for forming foreign Alliances '' and to prepare a plan of confederation for the newly independent states . Congress then created three overlapping committees to draft the Declaration , a Model Treaty , and the Articles of Confederation . The Declaration announced the states ' entry into the international system ; the model treaty was designed to establish amity and commerce with other states ; and the Articles of Confederation , which established `` a firm league '' among the thirteen free and independent states , constituted an international agreement to set up central institutions for the conduct of vital domestic and foreign affairs . </P> <H2> Drafting </H2> Articles of Confederation 200th Anniversary commemorative stamp . First issued in York , Pennsylvania. , 1977 <P> On June 12 , 1776 , a day after appointing a committee to prepare a draft of the Declaration of Independence , the Second Continental Congress resolved to appoint a committee of 13 to prepare a draft of a constitution for a union of the states . The committee met repeatedly , and chairman John Dickinson presented their results to the Congress on July 12 , 1776 . There were long debates on such issues as sovereignty , the exact powers to be given the confederate government , whether to have a judiciary , and voting procedures . The final draft of the Articles was prepared in the summer of 1777 and the Second Continental Congress approved them for ratification by the individual states on November 15 , 1777 , after a year of debate . Consensus was achieved by dividing sovereignty between the states and the central government , with a unicameral legislature that protected the liberty of the individual states . </P> <H2> Ratification </H2> <P> The Articles of Confederation was submitted to the states for ratification in November 1777 . The first state to ratify was Virginia on December 16 , 1777 ; 12 states had ratified the Articles by February 1779 , 14 months into the process . The lone holdout , Maryland , refused to go along until the landed states , especially Virginia , had indicated they were prepared to cede their claims west of the Ohio River to the Union . It would be two years before the Maryland General Assembly became satisfied that the various states would follow through , and voted to ratify . During this time , Congress observed the Articles as its de facto frame of government . Maryland finally ratified the Articles on February 2 , 1781 . Congress was informed of Maryland 's assent on March 1 , and officially proclaimed the Articles of Confederation to be the law of the land . </P> <P> The several states ratified the Articles of Confederation on the following dates : </P> <Table> <Tr> <Th_colspan=\"2\"> State </Th> <Th> Date </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 13 ! 1 </Td> <Td> Virginia </Td> <Td> 000000001777 - 12 - 16 - 0000 December 16 , 1777 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 12 ! 2 </Td> <Td> South Carolina </Td> <Td> 000000001778 - 02 - 05 - 0000 February 5 , 1778 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 08 ! 3 </Td> <Td> New York </Td> <Td> 000000001778 - 02 - 06 - 0000 February 6 , 1778 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 11 ! 4 </Td> <Td> Rhode Island </Td> <Td> 000000001778 - 02 - 09 - 0000 February 9 , 1778 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 01 ! 5 </Td> <Td> Connecticut </Td> <Td> 000000001778 - 02 - 12 - 0000 February 12 , 1778 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 03 ! 6 </Td> <Td> Georgia </Td> <Td> 000000001778 - 02 - 26 - 0000 February 26 , 1778 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 06 ! 7 </Td> <Td> New Hampshire </Td> <Td> 000000001778 - 03 - 04 - 0000 March 4 , 1778 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 10 ! 8 </Td> <Td> Pennsylvania </Td> <Td> 000000001778 - 03 - 05 - 0000 March 5 , 1778 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 05 ! 9 </Td> <Td> Massachusetts </Td> <Td> 000000001778 - 03 - 10 - 0000 March 10 , 1778 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 09 ! 10 </Td> <Td> North Carolina </Td> <Td> 000000001778 - 04 - 05 - 0000 April 5 , 1778 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 07 ! 11 </Td> <Td> New Jersey </Td> <Td> 000000001778 - 11 - 19 - 0000 November 19 , 1778 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 02 ! 12 </Td> <Td> Delaware </Td> <Td> 000000001779 - 02 - 01 - 0000 February 1 , 1779 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 04 ! 13 </Td> <Td> Maryland </Td> <Td> 000000001781 - 02 - 02 - 0000 February 2 , 1781 </Td> </Tr> </Table> <H2> Article summaries </H2> <P> The Articles of Confederation contain a preamble , thirteen articles , a conclusion , and a signatory section . The individual articles set the rules for current and future operations of the confederation 's central government . Under the Articles , the states retained sovereignty over all governmental functions not specifically relinquished to the national Congress , which was empowered to make war and peace , negotiate diplomatic and commercial agreements with foreign countries , and to resolve disputes between the states . The document also stipulates that its provisions `` shall be inviolably observed by every state '' and that `` the Union shall be perpetual '' . </P> <P> Summary of the purpose and content of each of the 13 articles : </P> <Ol> <Li> Establishes the name of the confederation with these words : `` The stile of this confederacy shall be ' The United States of America . ' '' </Li> <Li> Asserts the sovereignty of each state , except for the specific powers delegated to the confederation government : `` Each state retains its sovereignty , freedom , and independence , and every power , jurisdiction , and right , which is not by this Confederation expressly delegated . '' </Li> <Li> Declares the purpose of the confederation : `` The said States hereby severally enter into a firm league of friendship with each other , for their common defense , the security of their liberties , and their mutual and general welfare , binding themselves to assist each other , against all force offered to , or attacks made upon them , or any of them , on account of religion , sovereignty , trade , or any other pretense whatever . '' </Li> <Li> Elaborates upon the intent `` to secure and perpetuate mutual friendship and intercourse among the people of the different States in this union , '' and to establish equal treatment and freedom of movement for the free inhabitants of each state to pass unhindered between the states , excluding `` paupers , vagabonds , and fugitives from justice . '' All these people are entitled to equal rights established by the state into which they travel . If a crime is committed in one state and the perpetrator flees to another state , he will be extradited to and tried in the state in which the crime was committed . </Li> <Li> Allocates one vote in the Congress of the Confederation ( the `` United States in Congress Assembled '' ) to each state , which is entitled to a delegation of between two and seven members . Members of Congress are to be appointed by state legislatures . No congressman may serve more than three out of any six years . </Li> <Li> Only the central government may declare war , or conduct foreign political or commercial relations . No state or official may accept foreign gifts or titles , and granting any title of nobility is forbidden to all . No states may form any sub-national groups . No state may tax or interfere with treaty stipulations already proposed . No state may wage war without permission of Congress , unless invaded or under imminent attack on the frontier ; no state may maintain a peacetime standing army or navy , unless infested by pirates , but every State is required to keep ready , a well - trained , disciplined , and equipped militia . </Li> <Li> Whenever an army is raised for common defense , the state legislatures shall assign military ranks of colonel and below . </Li> <Li> Expenditures by the United States of America will be paid with funds raised by state legislatures , and apportioned to the states in proportion to the real property values of each . </Li> <Li> Powers and functions of the United States in Congress Assembled . <Ul> <Li> Grants to the United States in Congress assembled the sole and exclusive right and power to determine peace and war ; to exchange ambassadors ; to enter into treaties and alliances , with some provisos ; to establish rules for deciding all cases of captures or prizes on land or water ; to grant letters of marque and reprisal ( documents authorizing privateers ) in times of peace ; to appoint courts for the trial of pirates and crimes committed on the high seas ; to establish courts for appeals in all cases of captures , but no member of Congress may be appointed a judge ; to set weights and measures ( including coins ) , and for Congress to serve as a final court for disputes between states . </Li> <Li> The court will be composed of jointly appointed commissioners or Congress shall appoint them . Each commissioner is bound by oath to be impartial . The court 's decision is final . </Li> <Li> Congress shall regulate the post offices ; appoint officers in the military ; and regulate the armed forces . </Li> <Li> The United States in Congress assembled may appoint a president who shall not serve longer than one year per three - year term of the Congress . </Li> <Li> Congress may request requisitions ( demands for payments or supplies ) from the states in proportion with their population , or take credit . </Li> <Li> Congress may not declare war , enter into treaties and alliances , appropriate money , or appoint a commander in chief without nine states assented . Congress shall keep a journal of proceedings and adjourn for periods not to exceed six months . </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> When Congress is in recess , any of the powers of Congress may be executed by `` The committee of the states , or any nine of them '' , except for those powers of Congress which require nine states in Congress to execute . </Li> <Li> If `` Canada '' ( as the British - held Province of Quebec was also known ) accedes to this confederation , it will be admitted . No other colony could be admitted without the consent of nine states . </Li> <Li> Reaffirms that the Confederation accepts war debt incurred by Congress before the existence of the Articles . </Li> <Li> Declares that the Articles shall be perpetual , and may be altered only with the approval of Congress and the ratification of all the state legislatures . </Li> </Ol> <H2> Congress under the Articles </H2> <H3> The army </H3> <P> Under the Articles , Congress had the authority to regulate and fund the Continental Army , but it lacked the power to compel the States to comply with requests for either troops or funding . This left the military vulnerable to inadequate funding , supplies , and even food . Further , although the Articles enabled the states to present a unified front when dealing with the European powers , as a tool to build a centralized war - making government , they were largely a failure ; Historian Bruce Chadwick wrote : </P> <P> George Washington had been one of the very first proponents of a strong federal government . The army had nearly disbanded on several occasions during the winters of the war because of the weaknesses of the Continental Congress ... The delegates could not draft soldiers and had to send requests for regular troops and militia to the states . Congress had the right to order the production and purchase of provisions for the soldiers , but could not force anyone to supply them , and the army nearly starved in several winters of war . </P> <P> The Continental Congress , before the Articles were approved , had promised soldiers a pension of half pay for life . However Congress had no power to compel the states to fund this obligation , and as the war wound down after the victory at Yorktown the sense of urgency to support the military was no longer a factor . No progress was made in Congress during the winter of 1783 -- 84 . General Henry Knox , who would later become the first Secretary of War under the Constitution , blamed the weaknesses of the Articles for the inability of the government to fund the army . The army had long been supportive of a strong union . Knox wrote : </P> <P> The army generally have always reprobated the idea of being thirteen armies . Their ardent desires have been to be one continental body looking up to one sovereign ... It is a favorite toast in the army , `` A hoop to the barrel '' or `` Cement to the Union '' . </P> <P> As Congress failed to act on the petitions , Knox wrote to Gouverneur Morris , four years before the Philadelphia Convention was convened , `` As the present Constitution is so defective , why do not you great men call the people together and tell them so ; that is , to have a convention of the States to form a better Constitution . '' </P> <P> Once the war had been won , the Continental Army was largely disbanded . A very small national force was maintained to man the frontier forts and to protect against Native American attacks . Meanwhile , each of the states had an army ( or militia ) , and 11 of them had navies . The wartime promises of bounties and land grants to be paid for service were not being met . In 1783 , George Washington defused the Newburgh conspiracy , but riots by unpaid Pennsylvania veterans forced Congress to leave Philadelphia temporarily . </P> <P> The Congress from time to time during the Revolutionary War requisitioned troops from the states . Any contributions were voluntary , and in the debates of 1788 the Federalists ( who supported the proposed new Constitution ) claimed that state politicians acted unilaterally , and contributed when the Continental army protected their state 's interests . The Anti-Federalists claimed that state politicians understood their duty to the Union and contributed to advance its needs . Dougherty ( 2009 ) concludes that generally the States ' behavior validated the Federalist analysis . This helps explain why the Articles of Confederation needed reforms . </P> <H3> Foreign policy </H3> <P> The 1783 Treaty of Paris , which ended hostilities with Great Britain , languished in Congress for several months because too few delegates were present at any one time to constitute a quorum so that it could be ratified . Afterward , the problem only got worse as Congress had no power to enforce attendance . Rarely did more than half of the roughly sixty delegates attend a session of Congress at the time , causing difficulties in raising a quorum . The resulting paralysis embarrassed and frustrated many American nationalists , including George Washington . Many of the most prominent national leaders , such as Washington , John Adams , John Hancock , and Benjamin Franklin , retired from public life , served as foreign delegates , or held office in state governments ; and for the general public , local government and self - rule seemed quite satisfactory . This served to exacerbate Congress 's impotence . </P> <P> Inherent weaknesses in the confederation 's frame of government also frustrated the ability of the government to conduct foreign policy . In 1786 , Thomas Jefferson , concerned over the failure of Congress to fund an American naval force to confront the Barbary pirates , wrote in a diplomatic correspondence to James Monroe that , `` It will be said there is no money in the treasury . There never will be money in the treasury till the Confederacy shows its teeth . '' </P> <P> Furthermore , the 1786 Jay -- Gardoqui Treaty with Spain also showed weakness in foreign policy . In this treaty , which was never ratified , the United States was to give up rights to use the Mississippi River for 25 years , which would have economically strangled the settlers west of the Appalachian Mountains . Finally , due to the Confederation 's military weakness , it could not compel the British army to leave frontier forts which were on American soil -- forts which , in 1783 , the British promised to leave , but which they delayed leaving pending U.S. implementation of other provisions such as ending action against Loyalists and allowing them to seek compensation . This incomplete British implementation of the Treaty of Paris would later be resolved by the implementation of Jay 's Treaty in 1795 , after the federal Constitution came into force . </P> <H3> Taxation and commerce </H3> <P> Under the Articles of Confederation , the central government 's power was kept quite limited . The Confederation Congress could make decisions , but lacked enforcement powers . Implementation of most decisions , including modifications to the Articles , required unanimous approval of all thirteen state legislatures . </P> <P> Congress was denied any powers of taxation : it could only request money from the states . The states often failed to meet these requests in full , leaving both Congress and the Continental Army chronically short of money . As more money was printed by Congress , the continental dollars depreciated . In 1779 , George Washington wrote to John Jay , who was serving as the president of the Continental Congress , `` that a wagon load of money will scarcely purchase a wagon load of provisions . '' Mr. Jay and the Congress responded in May by requesting $45 million from the States . In an appeal to the States to comply , Jay wrote that the taxes were `` the price of liberty , the peace , and the safety of yourselves and posterity . '' He argued that Americans should avoid having it said `` that America had no sooner become independent than she became insolvent '' or that `` her infant glories and growing fame were obscured and tarnished by broken contracts and violated faith . '' The States did not respond with any of the money requested from them . </P> <P> Congress had also been denied the power to regulate either foreign trade or interstate commerce and , as a result , all of the States maintained control over their own trade policies . The states and the Confederation Congress both incurred large debts during the Revolutionary War , and how to repay those debts became a major issue of debate following the War . Some States paid off their war debts and others did not . Federal assumption of the states ' war debts became a major issue in the deliberations of the Constitutional Convention . </P> <H3> Accomplishments </H3> <Table> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> This section does not cite any sources .

The Land Ordinance of 1785 and Northwest Ordinance created territorial government , set up protocols for the admission of new states and the division of land into useful units , and set aside land in each township for public use . This system represented a sharp break from imperial colonization , as in Europe , and it established the precedent by which the national ( later , federal ) government would be sovereign and expand westward -- as opposed to the existing states doing so under their sovereignty . </P> <P> The Land Ordinance of 1785 established both the general practices of land surveying in the west and northwest and the land ownership provisions used throughout the later westward expansion beyond the Mississippi River . Frontier lands were surveyed into the now - familiar squares of land called the township ( 36 square miles ) , the section ( one square mile ) , and the quarter section ( 160 acres ) . This system was carried forward to most of the States west of the Mississippi ( excluding areas of Texas and California that had already been surveyed and divided up by the Spanish Empire ) . Then , when the Homestead Act was enacted in 1867 , the quarter section became the basic unit of land that was granted to new settler - farmers . </P> <P> The Northwest Ordinance of 1787 noted the agreement of the original states to give up northwestern land claims , organized the Northwest Territory and laid the groundwork for the eventual creation of new states . While it did n't happen under the articles , the land north of the Ohio River and west of the ( present ) western border of Pennsylvania ceded by Massachusetts , Connecticut , New York , Pennsylvania , and Virginia , eventually became the states of : Ohio , Indiana , Illinois , Michigan , and Wisconsin , and the part of Minnesota east of the Mississippi River . The Northwest Ordinance of 1787 also made great advances in the abolition of slavery . New states admitted to the union in this territory would never be slave states . </P> <P> No new states were admitted to the Union under the Articles of Confederation . The Articles provided for a blanket acceptance of the Province of Quebec ( referred to as `` Canada '' in the Articles ) into the United States if it chose to do so . It did not , and the subsequent Constitution carried no such special provision of admission . Additionally , ordinances to admit Frankland ( later modified to Franklin ) , Kentucky , and Vermont to the Union were considered , but none were approved . </P> <H3> Presidents of Congress </H3> Further information : President of the Continental Congress <P> Under the Articles of Confederation , the presiding officer of Congress -- referred to in many official records as President of the United States in Congress Assembled -- chaired the Committee of the States when Congress was in recess , and performed other administrative functions . He was not , however , an executive in the way the later President of the United States is a chief executive , since all of the functions he executed were under the direct control of Congress . </P> <P> There were 10 presidents of Congress under the Articles . The first , Samuel Huntington , had been serving as president of the Continental Congress since September 28 , 1779 . </P> <Table> <Tr> <Th> President </Th> <Th> Term </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Samuel Huntington </Td> <Td> 01 !

The Articles envisioned a permanent confederation , but granted to the Congress -- the only federal institution -- little power to finance itself or to ensure that its resolutions were enforced . There was no president , no executive agencies , no judiciary and no tax base . The absence of a tax base meant that there was no way to pay off state and national debts from the war years except by requesting money from the states , which seldom arrived . Although historians generally agree that the Articles were too weak to hold the fast - growing nation together , they do give credit to the settlement of the western issue , as the states voluntarily turned over their lands to national control . </P> <P> By 1783 , with the end of the British blockade , the new nation was regaining its prosperity . However , trade opportunities were restricted by the mercantilism of the British and French empires . The ports of the British West Indies were closed to all staple products which were not carried in British ships . France and Spain established similar policies . Simultaneously , new manufacturers faced sharp competition from British products which were suddenly available again . Political unrest in several states and efforts by debtors to use popular government to erase their debts increased the anxiety of the political and economic elites which had led the Revolution . The apparent inability of the Congress to redeem the public obligations ( debts ) incurred during the war , or to become a forum for productive cooperation among the states to encourage commerce and economic development , only aggravated a gloomy situation . In 1786 -- 87 , Shays ' Rebellion , an uprising of dissidents in western Massachusetts against the state court system , threatened the stability of state government . </P> <P> The Continental Congress printed paper money which was so depreciated that it ceased to pass as currency , spawning the expression `` not worth a continental '' . Congress could not levy taxes and could only make requisitions upon the States . Less than a million and a half dollars came into the treasury between 1781 and 1784 , although the governors had been asked for two million in 1783 alone . </P> <P> When John Adams went to London in 1785 as the first representative of the United States , he found it impossible to secure a treaty for unrestricted commerce . Demands were made for favors and there was no assurance that individual states would agree to a treaty . Adams stated it was necessary for the States to confer the power of passing navigation laws to Congress , or that the States themselves pass retaliatory acts against Great Britain . Congress had already requested and failed to get power over navigation laws . Meanwhile , each State acted individually against Great Britain to little effect . When other New England states closed their ports to British shipping , Connecticut hastened to profit by opening its ports . </P> <P> By 1787 Congress was unable to protect manufacturing and shipping . State legislatures were unable or unwilling to resist attacks upon private contracts and public credit . Land speculators expected no rise in values when the government could not defend its borders nor protect its frontier population . </P> <P> The idea of a convention to revise the Articles of Confederation grew in favor . Alexander Hamilton realized while serving as Washington 's top aide that a strong central government was necessary to avoid foreign intervention and allay the frustrations due to an ineffectual Congress . Hamilton led a group of like - minded nationalists , won Washington 's endorsement , and convened the Annapolis Convention in 1786 to petition Congress to call a constitutional convention to meet in Philadelphia to remedy the long - term crisis . </P> <H2> Signatures </H2> <P> The Second Continental Congress approved the Articles for distribution to the states on November 15 , 1777 . A copy was made for each state and one was kept by the Congress . On November 28 , the copies sent to the states for ratification were unsigned , and the cover letter , dated November 17 , had only the signatures of Henry Laurens and Charles Thomson , who were the President and Secretary to the Congress . </P> <P> The Articles , however , were unsigned , and the date was blank . Congress began the signing process by examining their copy of the Articles on June 27 , 1778 . They ordered a final copy prepared ( the one in the National Archives ) , and that delegates should inform the secretary of their authority for ratification . </P> <P> On July 9 , 1778 , the prepared copy was ready . They dated it , and began to sign . They also requested each of the remaining states to notify its delegation when ratification was completed . On that date , delegates present from New Hampshire , Massachusetts , Rhode Island , Connecticut , New York , Pennsylvania , Virginia and South Carolina signed the Articles to indicate that their states had ratified . New Jersey , Delaware and Maryland could not , since their states had not ratified . North Carolina and Georgia also were unable to sign that day , since their delegations were absent . </P> <P> After the first signing , some delegates signed at the next meeting they attended . For example , John Wentworth of New Hampshire added his name on August 8 . John Penn was the first of North Carolina 's delegates to arrive ( on July 10 ) , and the delegation signed the Articles on July 21 , 1778 . </P> <P> The other states had to wait until they ratified the Articles and notified their Congressional delegation . Georgia signed on July 24 , New Jersey on November 26 , and Delaware on February 12 , 1779 . Maryland refused to ratify the Articles until every state had ceded its western land claims . Chevalier de La Luzerne , French Minister to the United States , felt that the Articles would help strengthen the American government . In 1780 when Maryland requested France provide naval forces in the Chesapeake Bay for protection from the British ( who were conducting raids in the lower part of the bay ) , he indicated that French Admiral Destouches would do what he could but La Luzerne also `` sharply pressed '' Maryland to ratify the Articles , thus suggesting the two issues were related . </P> The Act of the Maryland legislature to ratify the Articles of Confederation on February 2 , 1781 <P> On February 2 , 1781 , the much - awaited decision was taken by the Maryland General Assembly in Annapolis . As the last piece of business during the afternoon Session , `` among engrossed Bills '' was `` signed and sealed by Governor Thomas Sim Lee in the Senate Chamber , in the presence of the members of both Houses ... an Act to empower the delegates of this state in Congress to subscribe and ratify the articles of confederation '' and perpetual union among the states . The Senate then adjourned `` to the first Monday in August next . '' The decision of Maryland to ratify the Articles was reported to the Continental Congress on February 12 . The confirmation signing of the Articles by the two Maryland delegates took place in Philadelphia at noon time on March 1 , 1781 , and was celebrated in the afternoon . With these events , the Articles were entered into force and the United States of America came into being as a sovereign federal state . </P> <P> Congress had debated the Articles for over a year and a half , and the ratification process had taken nearly three and a half years . Many participants in the original debates were no longer delegates , and some of the signers had only recently arrived . The Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union were signed by a group of men who were never present in the Congress at the same time . </P> <H3> Signers </H3> <P> The signers and the states they represented were : </P> <Table> <Tr> <Td> <P> Connecticut </P> <Ul> <Li> Roger Sherman </Li> <Li> Samuel Huntington </Li> <Li> Oliver Wolcott </Li> <Li> Titus Hosmer </Li> <Li> Andrew Adams </Li> </Ul> <P> Delaware </P> <Ul> <Li> Thomas McKean </Li> <Li> John Dickinson </Li> <Li> Nicholas Van Dyke </Li> </Ul> <P> Georgia </P> <Ul> <Li> John Walton </Li> <Li> Edward Telfair </Li> <Li> Edward Langworthy </Li> </Ul> </Td> <Td> <P> Maryland </P> <Ul> <Li> John Hanson </Li> <Li> Daniel Carroll </Li> </Ul> <P> Massachusetts Bay </P> <Ul> <Li> John Hancock </Li> <Li> Samuel Adams </Li> <Li> Elbridge Gerry </Li> <Li> Francis Dana </Li> <Li> James Lovell </Li> <Li> Samuel Holten </Li> </Ul> <P> New Hampshire </P> <Ul> <Li> Josiah Bartlett </Li> <Li> John Wentworth Jr . </Li> </Ul> </Td> <Td> <P> New Jersey </P> <Ul> <Li> John Witherspoon </Li> <Li> Nathaniel Scudder </Li> </Ul> <P> New York </P> <Ul> <Li> James Duane </Li> <Li> Francis Lewis </Li> <Li> William Duer </Li> <Li> Gouverneur Morris </Li> </Ul> <P> North Carolina </P> <Ul> <Li> John Penn </Li> <Li> Cornelius Harnett </Li> <Li> John Williams </Li> </Ul> </Td> <Td> <P> Pennsylvania </P> <Ul> <Li> Robert Morris </Li> <Li> Daniel Roberdeau </Li> <Li> Jonathan Bayard Smith </Li> <Li> William Clingan </Li> <Li> Joseph Reed </Li> </Ul> <P> Rhode Island and Providence Plantations </P> <Ul> <Li> William Ellery </Li> <Li> Henry Marchant </Li> <Li> John Collins </Li> </Ul> </Td> <Td> <P> South Carolina </P> <Ul> <Li> Henry Laurens </Li> <Li> William Henry Drayton </Li> <Li> John Mathews </Li> <Li> Richard Hutson </Li> <Li> Thomas Heyward Jr . </Li> </Ul> <P> Virginia </P> <Ul> <Li> Richard Henry Lee </Li> <Li> John Banister </Li> <Li> Thomas Adams </Li> <Li> John Harvie </Li> <Li> Francis Lightfoot Lee </Li> </Ul> </Td> </Tr> </Table> <P> Roger Sherman ( Connecticut ) was the only person to sign all four great state papers of the United States : the Continental Association , the United States Declaration of Independence , the Articles of Confederation and the United States Constitution . </P> <P> Robert Morris ( Pennsylvania ) signed three of the great state papers of the United States : the United States Declaration of Independence , the Articles of Confederation and the United States Constitution . </P> <P> John Dickinson ( Delaware ) , Daniel Carroll ( Maryland ) and Gouverneur Morris ( New York ) , along with Sherman and Robert Morris , were the only five people to sign both the Articles of Confederation and the United States Constitution ( Gouverneur Morris represented Pennsylvania when signing the Constitution ) . </P> <H2> Gallery </H2> <P> Images of an original draft of the Articles of Confederation stored at the United States National Archive . </P> <Ul> <Li> <P> Preamble through Article V , \u00b6 1 </P> </Li> <Li> <P> Article V , \u00b6 2 through Article VI </P> </Li> <Li> <P> Article VII through Article IX , \u00b6 2 </P> </Li> <Li> <P> Article IX , \u00b6 2 through \u00b6 5 </P> </Li> <Li> <P> Article IX , \u00b6 5 through Article XIII , \u00b6 2 </P> </Li> <Li> <P> Article XIII , \u00b6 2 through signatures </P> </Li> </Ul> <H2> Revision and replacement </H2> <P> On January 21 , 1786 , the Virginia Legislature , following James Madison 's recommendation , invited all the states to send delegates to Annapolis , Maryland to discuss ways to reduce interstate conflict . At what came to be known as the Annapolis Convention , the few state delegates in attendance endorsed a motion that called for all states to meet in Philadelphia in May 1787 to discuss ways to improve the Articles of Confederation in a `` Grand Convention . '' Although the states ' representatives to the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia were only authorized to amend the Articles , the representatives held secret , closed - door sessions and wrote a new constitution . The new Constitution gave much more power to the central government , but characterization of the result is disputed . The general goal of the authors was to get close to a republic as defined by the philosophers of the Age of Enlightenment , while trying to address the many difficulties of the interstate relationships . Historian Forrest McDonald , using the ideas of James Madison from Federalist 39 , describes the change this way : </P> <P> The constitutional reallocation of powers created a new form of government , unprecedented under the sun . Every previous national authority either had been centralized or else had been a confederation of sovereign states . The new American system was neither one nor the other ; it was a mixture of both . </P> <P> In May 1786 , Charles Pinckney of South Carolina proposed that Congress revise the Articles of Confederation . Recommended changes included granting Congress power over foreign and domestic commerce , and providing means for Congress to collect money from state treasuries . Unanimous approval was necessary to make the alterations , however , and Congress failed to reach a consensus . The weakness of the Articles in establishing an effective unifying government was underscored by the threat of internal conflict both within and between the states , especially after Shays ' Rebellion threatened to topple the state government of Massachusetts . </P> <P> Historian Ralph Ketcham comments on the opinions of Patrick Henry , George Mason , and other Anti-Federalists who were not so eager to give up the local autonomy won by the revolution : </P> <P> Antifederalists feared what Patrick Henry termed the `` consolidated government '' proposed by the new Constitution . They saw in Federalist hopes for commercial growth and international prestige only the lust of ambitious men for a `` splendid empire '' that , in the time - honored way of empires , would oppress the people with taxes , conscription , and military campaigns . Uncertain that any government over so vast a domain as the United States could be controlled by the people , Antifederalists saw in the enlarged powers of the general government only the familiar threats to the rights and liberties of the people . </P> <P> Historians have given many reasons for the perceived need to replace the articles in 1787 . Jillson and Wilson ( 1994 ) point to the financial weakness as well as the norms , rules and institutional structures of the Congress , and the propensity to divide along sectional lines . </P> <P> Rakove ( 1988 ) identifies several factors that explain the collapse of the Confederation . The lack of compulsory direct taxation power was objectionable to those wanting a strong centralized state or expecting to benefit from such power . It could not collect customs after the war because tariffs were vetoed by Rhode Island . Rakove concludes that their failure to implement national measures `` stemmed not from a heady sense of independence but rather from the enormous difficulties that all the states encountered in collecting taxes , mustering men , and gathering supplies from a war - weary populace . '' The second group of factors Rakove identified derived from the substantive nature of the problems the Continental Congress confronted after 1783 , especially the inability to create a strong foreign policy . Finally , the Confederation 's lack of coercive power reduced the likelihood for profit to be made by political means , thus potential rulers were uninspired to seek power . </P> <P> When the war ended in 1783 , certain special interests had incentives to create a new `` merchant state , '' much like the British state people had rebelled against . In particular , holders of war scrip and land speculators wanted a central government to pay off scrip at face value and to legalize western land holdings with disputed claims . Also , manufacturers wanted a high tariff as a barrier to foreign goods , but competition among states made this impossible without a central government . </P> <H3> Legitimacy of closing down </H3> <P> Political scientist David C. Hendrickson writes that two prominent political leaders in the Confederation , John Jay of New York and Thomas Burke of North Carolina believed that `` the authority of the congress rested on the prior acts of the several states , to which the states gave their voluntary consent , and until those obligations were fulfilled , neither nullification of the authority of congress , exercising its due powers , nor secession from the compact itself was consistent with the terms of their original pledges . '' </P> <P> According to Article XIII of the Confederation , any alteration had to be approved unanimously : </P> <P> ( T ) he Articles of this Confederation shall be inviolably observed by every State , and the Union shall be perpetual ; nor shall any alteration at any time hereafter be made in any of them ; unless such alteration be agreed to in a Congress of the United States , and be afterwards confirmed by the legislatures of every State . </P> <P> On the other hand , Article VII of the proposed Constitution stated that it would become effective after ratification by a mere nine states , without unanimity : </P> <P> The Ratification of the Conventions of nine States , shall be sufficient for the Establishment of this Constitution between the States so ratifying the Same . </P> <P> The apparent tension between these two provisions was addressed at the time , and remains a topic of scholarly discussion . In 1788 , James Madison remarked ( in Federalist No. 40 ) that the issue had become moot : `` As this objection ... has been in a manner waived by those who have criticised the powers of the convention , I dismiss it without further observation . '' Nevertheless , it is an interesting historical and legal question whether opponents of the Constitution could have plausibly attacked the Constitution on that ground . At the time , there were state legislators who argued that the Constitution was not an alteration of the Articles of Confederation , but rather would be a complete replacement so the unanimity rule did not apply . Moreover , the Confederation had proven woefully inadequate and therefore was supposedly no longer binding . </P> <P> Modern scholars such as Francisco Forrest Martin agree that the Articles of Confederation had lost its binding force because many states had violated it , and thus `` other states - parties did not have to comply with the Articles ' unanimous consent rule '' . In contrast , law professor Akhil Amar suggests that there may not have really been any conflict between the Articles of Confederation and the Constitution on this point ; Article VI of the Confederation specifically allowed side deals among states , and the Constitution could be viewed as a side deal until all states ratified it . </P> <H3> Final months </H3> <P> On July 3 , 1788 , the Congress received New Hampshire 's all - important ninth ratification of the proposed Constitution , thus , according to its terms , establishing it as the new framework of governance for the ratifying states . The following day delegates considered a bill to admit Kentucky into the Union as a sovereign state . The discussion ended with Congress making the determination that , in light of this development , it would be `` unadvisable '' to admit Kentucky into the Union , as it could do so `` under the Articles of Confederation '' only , but not `` under the Constitution '' . </P> <P> By the end of July 1788 , 11 of the 13 states had ratified the new Constitution . Congress continued to convene under the Articles with a quorum until October . On Saturday , September 13 , 1788 , the Confederation Congress voted the resolve to implement the new Constitution , and on Monday , September 15 published an announcement that the new Constitution had been ratified by the necessary nine states , set the first Wednesday in February 1789 for the presidential electors to meet and select a new president , and set the first Wednesday of March 1789 as the day the new government would take over and the government under the Articles of Confederation would come to an end . On that same September 13 , it determined that New York would remain the national capital . </P> <H2> See also </H2> <Ul> <Li> History of the United States ( 1776 -- 1789 ) </Li> <Li> Perpetual Union </Li> <Li> Vetocracy </Li> <Li> Court of Appeals in Cases of Capture </Li> </Ul> <H2> References </H2> <Ol> <Li> Jump up ^ Jensen , Merrill ( 1959 ) .

Confederation and Perpetual Union , was <wd_idx<130>> an agreement among the 13 original states of the United <wd_idx<140>> States of America that served as its first constitution . <wd_idx<150>> It was approved , after much debate ( between July <wd_idx<160>> 1776 and November 1777 ) , by the Second Continental <wd_idx<170>> Congress on November 15 , 1777 , and sent to <wd_idx<180>> the states for ratification . The Articles of Confederation came <wd_idx<190>> into force on March 1 , 1781 , after being <wd_idx<200>> ratified by all 13 states . A guiding principle of <wd_idx<210>> the Articles was to preserve the independence and sovereignty of <wd_idx<220>> the states . The federal government received only those powers <wd_idx<230", "<wd_idx<200>> ratified by all 13 states . A guiding principle of <wd_idx<210>> the Articles was to preserve the independence and sovereignty of <wd_idx<220>> the states . The federal government received only those powers <wd_idx<230>> which the colonies had recognized as belonging to king and <wd_idx<240>> parliament . </P> <P> The Articles formed a war - <wd_idx<250>> time confederation of states , with an extremely limited central <wd_idx<260>> government . While unratified , the document was used by <wd_idx<270>> the Congress to conduct business , direct the American Revolutionary <wd_idx<280>> War , conduct diplomacy with foreign nations , and deal <wd_idx<290>> with territorial issues and Native American relations . The adoption <wd_idx<300>> of the Articles made few perceptible changes in the federal <wd_idx<310>> government , because it did little more than legalize what <wd_idx<320>> the Continental Congress had been doing . That body was <wd_idx<330>> renamed the Congress of the Confederation ; but Americans continued <wd_idx<340>> to call it the Continental Congress , since its organization <wd_idx<350>> remained the same . </P> <P> As the Confederation Congress <wd_", "<wd_idx<330>> renamed the Congress of the Confederation ; but Americans continued <wd_idx<340>> to call it the Continental Congress , since its organization <wd_idx<350>> remained the same . </P> <P> As the Confederation Congress <wd_idx<360>> attempted to govern the continually growing American states , delegates <wd_idx<370>> discovered that the limitations placed upon the central government rendered <wd_idx<380>> it ineffective at doing so . As the government 's <wd_idx<390>> weaknesses became apparent , especially after Shays ' Rebellion , <wd_idx<400>> individuals began asking for changes to the Articles . Their <wd_idx<410>> hope was to create a stronger national government . Initially <wd_idx<420>> , some states met to deal with their trade and <wd_idx<430>> economic problems . However , as more states became interested <wd_idx<440>> in meeting to change the Articles , a meeting was <wd_idx<450>> set in Philadelphia on May 25 , 1787 . This <wd_idx<460>> became the Constitutional Convention . It was quickly realized that <wd_idx<470>> changes would not work , and instead the entire Articles <wd_idx<480>> needed to be replaced . On March 4 , 1789 <wd_idx", "<wd_idx<460>> became the Constitutional Convention . It was quickly realized that <wd_idx<470>> changes would not work , and instead the entire Articles <wd_idx<480>> needed to be replaced . On March 4 , 1789 <wd_idx<490>> , the government under the Articles was replaced with the <wd_idx<500>> federal government under the Constitution . The new Constitution provided <wd_idx<510>> for a much stronger federal government by establishing a chief <wd_idx<520>> executive ( the President ) , courts , and taxing <wd_idx<530>> powers . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide <wd_idx<540>> ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Background and context </Li> <Li> 2 <wd_idx<550>> Drafting </Li> <Li> 3 Ratification </Li> <Li> 4 Article summaries <wd_idx<560>> </Li> <Li> 5 Congress under the Articles <Ul> <Li> 5.1 <wd_idx<570>> The Army </Li> <Li> 5.2 Foreign policy </Li> <Li> 5.3 <wd_idx<580>> Taxation and commerce </Li> <Li> 5.4 Accomplishments </Li> <Li>", "<wd_idx<570>> The Army </Li> <Li> 5.2 Foreign policy </Li> <Li> 5.3 <wd_idx<580>> Taxation and commerce </Li> <Li> 5.4 Accomplishments </Li> <Li> 5.5 <wd_idx<590>> Presidents of Congress </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 6 The U.S. <wd_idx<600>> under the Articles </Li> <Li> 7 Signatures <Ul> <Li> 7.1 <wd_idx<610>> Signers </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 8 Gallery </Li> <Li> 9 <wd_idx<620>> Revision and replacement <Ul> <Li> 9.1 Legitimacy of closing down <wd_idx<630>> </Li> <Li> 9.2 Final months </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 10 <wd_idx<640>> See also </Li> <Li> 11 References </Li> <Li> 12 Further <wd_idx<650>> reading </Li> <Li> 13 External links </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <wd_idx<660>> <H2> Background and Context </H2> <P> The political push to <wd_idx<670>> increase cooperation among the then - loyal colonies began with <wd_idx<680>> the Albany Congress in 1754 and Benjamin Franklin", "<wd_idx<660>> <H2> Background and Context </H2> <P> The political push to <wd_idx<670>> increase cooperation among the then - loyal colonies began with <wd_idx<680>> the Albany Congress in 1754 and Benjamin Franklin 's proposed <wd_idx<690>> Albany Plan , an inter-colonial collaboration to help solve mutual <wd_idx<700>> local problems . The Articles of Confederation would bear some <wd_idx<710>> resemblance to it . Over the next two decades , <wd_idx<720>> some of the basic concepts it addressed would strengthen and <wd_idx<730>> others would weaken , particularly the degree of deserved loyalty <wd_idx<740>> to the crown . With civil disobedience resulting in coercive <wd_idx<750>> , and what the colonials perceived as intolerable acts of <wd_idx<760>> Parliament , and armed conflict resulting in dissidents being proclaimed <wd_idx<770>> rebels and outside the King 's protection , any loyalty <wd_idx<780>> remaining shifted toward independence and how to achieve it . <wd_idx<790>> In 1775 , with events outpacing communications , the Second <wd_idx<800>> Continental Congress began acting as the provisional government that would <wd_idx<810>> run the American Revolutionary War and gain the colonies their <wd_idx", "<wd_idx<790>> In 1775 , with events outpacing communications , the Second <wd_idx<800>> Continental Congress began acting as the provisional government that would <wd_idx<810>> run the American Revolutionary War and gain the colonies their <wd_idx<820>> collective independence . </P> <P> It was an era of <wd_idx<830>> constitution writing -- most states were busy at the task <wd_idx<840>> -- and leaders felt the new nation must have a <wd_idx<850>> written constitution , even though other nations did not . <wd_idx<860>> During the war , Congress exercised an unprecedented level of <wd_idx<870>> political , diplomatic , military and economic authority . It <wd_idx<880>> adopted trade restrictions , established and maintained an army , <wd_idx<890>> issued fiat money , created a military code and negotiated <wd_idx<900>> with foreign governments . </P> <P> To transform themselves from <wd_idx<910>> outlaws into a legitimate nation , the colonists needed international <wd_idx<920>> recognition for their cause and foreign allies to support it <wd_idx<930>> . In early 1776 , Thomas Paine argued in the <wd_idx<940>> closing pages of the first edition of Common Sense that <wd_idx", "<wd_idx<920>> recognition for their cause and foreign allies to support it <wd_idx<930>> . In early 1776 , Thomas Paine argued in the <wd_idx<940>> closing pages of the first edition of Common Sense that <wd_idx<950>> the `` custom of nations '' demanded a formal declaration <wd_idx<960>> of American independence if any European power were to mediate <wd_idx<970>> a peace between the Americans and Great Britain . The <wd_idx<980>> monarchies of France and Spain in particular could not be <wd_idx<990>> expected to aid those they considered rebels against another legitimate <wd_idx<1000>> monarch . Foreign courts needed to have American grievances laid <wd_idx<1010>> before them persuasively in a `` manifesto '' which could <wd_idx<1020>> also reassure them that the Americans would be reliable trading <wd_idx<1030>> partners . Without such a declaration , Paine concluded , <wd_idx<1040>> `` ( t ) he custom of all courts is <wd_idx<1050>> against us , and will be so , until , <wd_idx<1060>> by an independence , we take rank with other nations <wd_idx<1070>> . '' </P> <P> Beyond improving their existing association ,", "<wd_idx<1050>> against us , and will be so , until , <wd_idx<1060>> by an independence , we take rank with other nations <wd_idx<1070>> . '' </P> <P> Beyond improving their existing association , <wd_idx<1080>> the records of the Second Continental Congress show that the <wd_idx<1090>> need for a declaration of independence was intimately linked with <wd_idx<1100>> the demands of international relations . On June 7 , <wd_idx<1110>> 1776 , Richard Henry Lee introduced a resolution before the <wd_idx<1120>> Continental Congress declaring the colonies independent ; at the same <wd_idx<1130>> time he also urged Congress to resolve `` to take <wd_idx<1140>> the most effectual measures for forming foreign Alliances '' and <wd_idx<1150>> to prepare a plan of confederation for the newly independent <wd_idx<1160>> states . Congress then created three overlapping committees to draft <wd_idx<1170>> the Declaration , a Model Treaty , and the Articles <wd_idx<1180>> of Confederation . The Declaration announced the states ' entry <wd_idx<1190>> into the international system ; the model treaty was designed <wd_idx<1200>> to establish amity and commerce with other states ; and <wd_id", "<wd_idx<1180>> of Confederation . The Declaration announced the states ' entry <wd_idx<1190>> into the international system ; the model treaty was designed <wd_idx<1200>> to establish amity and commerce with other states ; and <wd_idx<1210>> the Articles of Confederation , which established `` a firm <wd_idx<1220>> league '' among the thirteen free and independent states , <wd_idx<1230>> constituted an international agreement to set up central institutions for <wd_idx<1240>> the conduct of vital domestic and foreign affairs . </P> <wd_idx<1250>> <H2> Drafting </H2> Articles of Confederation 200th Anniversary commemorative stamp <wd_idx<1260>> . First issued in York , Pennsylvania. , 1977 <P> <wd_idx<1270>> On June 12 , 1776 , a day after appointing <wd_idx<1280>> a committee to prepare a draft of the Declaration of <wd_idx<1290>> Independence , the Second Continental Congress resolved to appoint a <wd_idx<1300>> committee of 13 to prepare a draft of a constitution <wd_idx<1310>> for a union of the states . The committee met <wd_idx<1320>> repeatedly , and chairman John Dickinson presented their results to <wd_id", "<wd_idx<1300>> committee of 13 to prepare a draft of a constitution <wd_idx<1310>> for a union of the states . The committee met <wd_idx<1320>> repeatedly , and chairman John Dickinson presented their results to <wd_idx<1330>> the Congress on July 12 , 1776 . There were <wd_idx<1340>> long debates on such issues as sovereignty , the exact <wd_idx<1350>> powers to be given the confederate government , whether to <wd_idx<1360>> have a judiciary , and voting procedures . The final <wd_idx<1370>> draft of the Articles was prepared in the summer of <wd_idx<1380>> 1777 and the Second Continental Congress approved them for ratification <wd_idx<1390>> by the individual states on November 15 , 1777 , <wd_idx<1400>> after a year of debate . Consensus was achieved by <wd_idx<1410>> dividing sovereignty between the states and the central government , <wd_idx<1420>> with a unicameral legislature that protected the liberty of the <wd_idx<1430>> individual states . </P> <H2> Ratification </H2> <P> The Articles <wd_idx<1440>> of Confederation was submitted to the states for ratification in <wd_idx<1450>> November 1777", "<wd_idx<1430>> individual states . </P> <H2> Ratification </H2> <P> The Articles <wd_idx<1440>> of Confederation was submitted to the states for ratification in <wd_idx<1450>> November 1777 . The first state to ratify was Virginia <wd_idx<1460>> on December 16 , 1777 ; 12 states had ratified <wd_idx<1470>> the Articles by February 1779 , 14 months into the <wd_idx<1480>> process . The lone holdout , Maryland , refused to <wd_idx<1490>> go along until the landed states , especially Virginia , <wd_idx<1500>> had indicated they were prepared to cede their claims west <wd_idx<1510>> of the Ohio River to the Union . It would <wd_idx<1520>> be two years before the Maryland General Assembly became satisfied <wd_idx<1530>> that the various states would follow through , and voted <wd_idx<1540>> to ratify . During this time , Congress observed the <wd_idx<1550>> Articles as its de facto frame of government . Maryland <wd_idx<1560>> finally ratified the Articles on February 2 , 1781 . <wd_idx<1570>> Congress was informed of Maryland 's assent on March 1 ", "<wd_idx<1550>> Articles as its de facto frame of government .

This left the military <wd_idx<3060>> vulnerable to inadequate funding , supplies , and even food <wd_idx<3070>> . Further , although the Articles enabled the states to <wd_idx<3080>> present a unified front when dealing with the European powers <wd_idx<3090>> , as a tool to build a centralized war - <wd_idx<3100>> making government , they were largely a failure ; Historian <wd_idx<3110>> Bruce Chadwick wrote : </P> <P> George Washington had been <wd_idx<3120>> one of the very first proponents of a strong federal <wd_idx<3130>> government . The army had nearly disbanded on several occasions <wd_idx<3140>> during the winters of the war because of the weaknesses <wd_idx<3150>> of the Continental Congress ... The delegates could not draft <wd_idx<3160>> soldiers and had to send requests for regular troops and <wd_idx<3170>> militia to the states . Congress had the right to <wd_id", "<wd_idx<3150>> of the Continental Congress ... The delegates could not draft <wd_idx<3160>> soldiers and had to send requests for regular troops and <wd_idx<3170>> militia to the states . Congress had the right to <wd_idx<3180>> order the production and purchase of provisions for the soldiers <wd_idx<3190>> , but could not force anyone to supply them , <wd_idx<3200>> and the army nearly starved in several winters of war <wd_idx<3210>> . </P> <P> The Continental Congress , before the Articles <wd_idx<3220>> were approved , had promised soldiers a pension of half <wd_idx<3230>> pay for life . However Congress had no power to <wd_idx<3240>> compel the states to fund this obligation , and as <wd_idx<3250>> the war wound down after the victory at Yorktown the <wd_idx<3260>> sense of urgency to support the military was no longer <wd_idx<3270>> a factor . No progress was made in Congress during <wd_idx<3280>> the winter of 1783 -- 84 . General Henry Knox <wd_idx<3290>> , who would later become the first Secretary of War <wd_idx<3300>> under the Constitution , blamed the weaknesses of the Articles <wd_", "<wd_idx<3280>> the winter of 1783 -- 84 . General Henry Knox <wd_idx<3290>> , who would later become the first Secretary of War <wd_idx<3300>> under the Constitution , blamed the weaknesses of the Articles <wd_idx<3310>> for the inability of the government to fund the army <wd_idx<3320>> . The army had long been supportive of a strong <wd_idx<3330>> union . Knox wrote : </P> <P> The army generally <wd_idx<3340>> have always reprobated the idea of being thirteen armies . <wd_idx<3350>> Their ardent desires have been to be one continental body <wd_idx<3360>> looking up to one sovereign ... It is a favorite <wd_idx<3370>> toast in the army , `` A hoop to the <wd_idx<3380>> barrel '' or `` Cement to the Union '' . <wd_idx<3390>> </P> <P> As Congress failed to act on the petitions <wd_idx<3400>> , Knox wrote to Gouverneur Morris , four years before <wd_idx<3410>> the Philadelphia Convention was convened , `` As the present <wd_idx<3420>> Constitution is so defective , why do not you great ", "<wd_idx<3400>> , Knox wrote to Gouverneur Morris , four years before <wd_idx<3410>> the Philadelphia Convention was convened , `` As the present <wd_idx<3420>> Constitution is so defective , why do not you great <wd_idx<3430>> men call the people together and tell them so ; <wd_idx<3440>> that is , to have a convention of the States <wd_idx<3450>> to form a better Constitution . '' </P> <P> Once <wd_idx<3460>> the war had been won , the Continental Army was <wd_idx<3470>> largely disbanded . A very small national force was maintained <wd_idx<3480>> to man the frontier forts and to protect against Native <wd_idx<3490>> American attacks . Meanwhile , each of the states had <wd_idx<3500>> an army ( or militia ) , and 11 of <wd_idx<3510>> them had navies . The wartime promises of bounties and <wd_idx<3520>> land grants to be paid for service were not being <wd_idx<3530>> met . In 1783 , George Washington defused the Newburgh <wd_idx<3540>> conspiracy , but riots by unpaid Pennsylvania veterans forced Congress <wd_idx<3550>> to leave Philadelphia temporarily . </P> <P>", "<wd_idx<3530>> met . In 1783 , George Washington defused the Newburgh <wd_idx<3540>> conspiracy , but riots by unpaid Pennsylvania veterans forced Congress <wd_idx<3550>> to leave Philadelphia temporarily . </P> <P> The Congress from <wd_idx<3560>> time to time during the Revolutionary War requisitioned troops from <wd_idx<3570>> the states . Any contributions were voluntary , and in <wd_idx<3580>> the debates of 1788 the Federalists ( who supported the <wd_idx<3590>> proposed new Constitution ) claimed that state politicians acted unilaterally <wd_idx<3600>> , and contributed when the Continental army protected their state <wd_idx<3610>> 's interests . The Anti-Federalists claimed that state politicians understood <wd_idx<3620>> their duty to the Union and contributed to advance its <wd_idx<3630>> needs . Dougherty ( 2009 ) concludes that generally the <wd_idx<3640>> States ' behavior validated the Federalist analysis . This helps <wd_idx<3650>> explain why the Articles of Confederation needed reforms . </P> <wd_idx<3660>> <H3> Foreign policy </H3> <P> The 1783 Treaty of Paris <wd_idx<3670>> , which ended", "<wd_idx<3650>> explain why the Articles of Confederation needed reforms . </P> <wd_idx<3660>> <H3> Foreign policy </H3> <P> The 1783 Treaty of Paris <wd_idx<3670>> , which ended hostilities with Great Britain , languished in <wd_idx<3680>> Congress for several months because too few delegates were present <wd_idx<3690>> at any one time to constitute a quorum so that <wd_idx<3700>> it could be ratified . Afterward , the problem only <wd_idx<3710>> got worse as Congress had no power to enforce attendance <wd_idx<3720>> . Rarely did more than half of the roughly sixty <wd_idx<3730>> delegates attend a session of Congress at the time , <wd_idx<3740>> causing difficulties in raising a quorum . The resulting paralysis <wd_idx<3750>> embarrassed and frustrated many American nationalists , including George Washington <wd_idx<3760>> . Many of the most prominent national leaders , such <wd_idx<3770>> as Washington , John Adams , John Hancock , and <wd_idx<3780>> Benjamin Franklin , retired from public life , served as <wd_idx<3790>> foreign delegates , or held office in state governments ; <wd_id", "<wd_idx<3770>> as Washington , John Adams , John Hancock , and <wd_idx<3780>> Benjamin Franklin , retired from public life , served as <wd_idx<3790>> foreign delegates , or held office in state governments ; <wd_idx<3800>> and for the general public , local government and self <wd_idx<3810>> - rule seemed quite satisfactory . This served to exacerbate <wd_idx<3820>> Congress 's impotence . </P> <P> Inherent weaknesses in the <wd_idx<3830>> confederation 's frame of government also frustrated the ability of <wd_idx<3840>> the government to conduct foreign policy . In 1786 , <wd_idx<3850>> Thomas Jefferson , concerned over the failure of Congress to <wd_idx<3860>> fund an American naval force to confront the Barbary pirates <wd_idx<3870>> , wrote in a diplomatic correspondence to James Monroe that <wd_idx<3880>> , `` It will be said there is no money <wd_idx<3890>> in the treasury . There never will be money in <wd_idx<3900>> the treasury till the Confederacy shows its teeth . '' <wd_idx<3910>> </P> <P> Furthermore , the 1786 Jay -- Gard", "<wd_idx<3890>> in the treasury . There never will be money in <wd_idx<3900>> the treasury till the Confederacy shows its teeth . '' <wd_idx<3910>> </P> <P> Furthermore , the 1786 Jay -- Gardoqui Treaty <wd_idx<3920>> with Spain also showed weakness in foreign policy . In <wd_idx<3930>> this treaty , which was never ratified , the United <wd_idx<3940>> States was to give up rights to use the Mississippi <wd_idx<3950>> River for 25 years , which would have economically strangled <wd_idx<3960>> the settlers west of the Appalachian Mountains . Finally , <wd_idx<3970>> due to the Confederation 's military weakness , it could <wd_idx<3980>> not compel the British army to leave frontier forts which <wd_idx<3990>> were on American soil -- forts which , in 1783 <wd_idx<4000>> , the British promised to leave , but which they <wd_idx<4010>> delayed leaving pending U.S. implementation of other provisions such as <wd_idx<4020>> ending action against Loyalists and allowing them to seek compensation <wd_idx<4030>> . This incomplete British implementation of the Treaty of Paris <wd_idx<4040>> would later be resolved by the implementation of Jay 's <wd", "<wd_idx<4020>> ending action against Loyalists and allowing them to seek compensation <wd_idx<4030>> . This incomplete British implementation of the Treaty of Paris <wd_idx<4040>> would later be resolved by the implementation of Jay 's <wd_idx<4050>> Treaty in 1795 , after the federal Constitution came into <wd_idx<4060>> force . </P> <H3> Taxation and commerce </H3> <P> Under <wd_idx<4070>> the Articles of Confederation , the central government 's power <wd_idx<4080>> was kept quite limited . The Confederation Congress could make <wd_idx<4090>> decisions , but lacked enforcement powers . Implementation of most <wd_idx<4100>> decisions , including modifications to the Articles , required unanimous <wd_idx<4110>> approval of all thirteen state legislatures . </P> <P> Congress <wd_idx<4120>> was denied any powers of taxation : it could only <wd_idx<4130>> request money from the states . The states often failed <wd_idx<4140>> to meet these requests in full , leaving both Congress <wd_idx<4150>> and the Continental Army chronically short of money . As <wd_idx<4160>> more money was printed by Congress , the continental dollars <wd_id", "<wd_idx<4140>> to meet these requests in full , leaving both Congress <wd_idx<4150>> and the Continental Army chronically short of money . As <wd_idx<4160>> more money was printed by Congress , the continental dollars <wd_idx<4170>> depreciated . In 1779 , George Washington wrote to John <wd_idx<4180>> Jay , who was serving as the president of the <wd_idx<4190>> Continental Congress , `` that a wagon load of money <wd_idx<4200>> will scarcely purchase a wagon load of provisions . '' <wd_idx<4210>> Mr. Jay and the Congress responded in May by requesting <wd_idx<4220>> $45 million from the States . In an appeal to <wd_idx<4230>> the States to comply , Jay wrote that the taxes <wd_idx<4240>> were `` the price of liberty , the peace , <wd_idx<4250>> and the safety of yourselves and posterity . '' He <wd_idx<4260>> argued that Americans should avoid having it said `` that <wd_idx<4270>> America had no sooner become independent than she became insolvent <wd_idx<4280>> '' or that `` her infant glories and growing fame <wd_idx<4290>> were obscured and tarnished by broken contracts and violated faith ", "<wd_idx<4270>> America had no sooner become independent than she became insolvent <wd_idx<4280>> '' or that `` her infant glories and growing fame <wd_idx<4290>> were obscured and tarnished by broken contracts and violated faith <wd_idx<4300>> . '' The States did not respond with any of <wd_idx<4310>> the money requested from them . </P> <P> Congress had <wd_idx<4320>> also been denied the power to regulate either foreign trade <wd_idx<4330>> or interstate commerce and , as a result , all <wd_idx<4340>> of the States maintained control over their own trade policies <wd_idx<4350>> . The states and the Confederation Congress both incurred large <wd_idx<4360>> debts during the Revolutionary War , and how to repay <wd_idx<4370>> those debts became a major issue of debate following the <wd_idx<4380>> War . Some States paid off their war debts and <wd_idx<4390>> others did not .

The Land Ordinance of <wd_idx<4500>> 1785 and Northwest Ordinance created territorial government , set up <wd_idx<4510>> protocols for the admission of new states and the division <wd_idx<4520>> of land into useful units , and set aside land <wd_idx<4530>> in each township for public use . This system represented <wd_id", "<wd_idx<4510>> protocols for the admission of new states and the division <wd_idx<4520>> of land into useful units , and set aside land <wd_idx<4530>> in each township for public use . This system represented <wd_idx<4540>> a sharp break from imperial colonization , as in Europe <wd_idx<4550>> , and it established the precedent by which the national <wd_idx<4560>> ( later , federal ) government would be sovereign and <wd_idx<4570>> expand westward -- as opposed to the existing states doing <wd_idx<4580>> so under their sovereignty . </P> <P> The Land Ordinance <wd_idx<4590>> of 1785 established both the general practices of land surveying <wd_idx<4600>> in the west and northwest and the land ownership provisions <wd_idx<4610>> used throughout the later westward expansion beyond the Mississippi River <wd_idx<4620>> . Frontier lands were surveyed into the now - familiar <wd_idx<4630>> squares of land called the township ( 36 square miles <wd_idx<4640>> ) , the section ( one square mile ) , <wd_idx<4650>> and the quarter section ( 160 acres ) . This <wd_idx<4660>> system was carried forward to most of the States west <wd_id", "<wd_idx<4640>> ) , the section ( one square mile ) , <wd_idx<4650>> and the quarter section ( 160 acres ) . This <wd_idx<4660>> system was carried forward to most of the States west <wd_idx<4670>> of the Mississippi ( excluding areas of Texas and California <wd_idx<4680>> that had already been surveyed and divided up by the <wd_idx<4690>> Spanish Empire ) . Then , when the Homestead Act <wd_idx<4700>> was enacted in 1867 , the quarter section became the <wd_idx<4710>> basic unit of land that was granted to new settler <wd_idx<4720>> - farmers . </P> <P> The Northwest Ordinance of 1787 <wd_idx<4730>> noted the agreement of the original states to give up <wd_idx<4740>> northwestern land claims , organized the Northwest Territory and laid <wd_idx<4750>> the groundwork for the eventual creation of new states . <wd_idx<4760>> While it did n't happen under the articles , the <wd_idx<4770>> land north of the Ohio River and west of the <wd_idx<4780>> ( present ) western border of Pennsylvania ceded by Massachusetts <wd_idx<4790>> , Connecticut , New York , Pennsylvania , and Virginia <wd_", "<wd_idx<4770>> land north of the Ohio River and west of the <wd_idx<4780>> ( present ) western border of Pennsylvania ceded by Massachusetts <wd_idx<4790>> , Connecticut , New York , Pennsylvania , and Virginia <wd_idx<4800>> , eventually became the states of : Ohio , Indiana <wd_idx<4810>> , Illinois , Michigan , and Wisconsin , and the <wd_idx<4820>> part of Minnesota east of the Mississippi River . The <wd_idx<4830>> Northwest Ordinance of 1787 also made great advances in the <wd_idx<4840>> abolition of slavery . New states admitted to the union <wd_idx<4850>> in this territory would never be slave states . </P> <wd_idx<4860>> <P> No new states were admitted to the Union under <wd_idx<4870>> the Articles of Confederation . The Articles provided for a <wd_idx<4880>> blanket acceptance of the Province of Quebec ( referred to <wd_idx<4890>> as `` Canada '' in the Articles ) into the <wd_idx<4900>> United States if it chose to do so .

The <wd_idx<5320>> Articles envisioned a permanent confederation , but granted to the <wd_idx<5330>> Congress -- the only federal institution -- little power to <wd_idx<5340>> finance itself or to ensure that its resolutions were enforced <wd_idx<5350>> . There was no president , no executive agencies , <wd_idx<5360>> no judiciary and no tax base . The absence of <wd_idx<5370>> a tax base meant that there was no way to <wd_idx<5380>> pay off state and national debts from the war years <wd_idx<5390>> except by requesting money from the states , which seldom <wd_idx<5400>> arrived . Although historians generally agree that the Articles were <wd_idx<5410>> too weak to hold the fast - growing nation together <wd_idx<5420>> , they do give credit to the settlement of the <wd_idx<5430>> western issue , as the states voluntarily turned over their <wd_idx<5440>> lands to national control . </P> <P> By 1783 , <wd_idx<5450>> with the end of the British blockade , the", "<wd_idx<5430>> western issue , as the states voluntarily turned over their <wd_idx<5440>> lands to national control . </P> <P> By 1783 , <wd_idx<5450>> with the end of the British blockade , the new <wd_idx<5460>> nation was regaining its prosperity . However , trade opportunities <wd_idx<5470>> were restricted by the mercantilism of the British and French <wd_idx<5480>> empires . The ports of the British West Indies were <wd_idx<5490>> closed to all staple products which were not carried in <wd_idx<5500>> British ships . France and Spain established similar policies . <wd_idx<5510>> Simultaneously , new manufacturers faced sharp competition from British products <wd_idx<5520>> which were suddenly available again . Political unrest in several <wd_idx<5530>> states and efforts by debtors to use popular government to <wd_idx<5540>> erase their debts increased the anxiety of the political and <wd_idx<5550>> economic elites which had led the Revolution . The apparent <wd_idx<5560>> inability of the Congress to redeem the public obligations ( <wd_idx<5570>> debts ) incurred during the war , or to become <wd_id", "<wd_idx<5550>> economic elites which had led the Revolution . The apparent <wd_idx<5560>> inability of the Congress to redeem the public obligations ( <wd_idx<5570>> debts ) incurred during the war , or to become <wd_idx<5580>> a forum for productive cooperation among the states to encourage <wd_idx<5590>> commerce and economic development , only aggravated a gloomy situation <wd_idx<5600>> . In 1786 -- 87 , Shays ' Rebellion , <wd_idx<5610>> an uprising of dissidents in western Massachusetts against the state <wd_idx<5620>> court system , threatened the stability of state government . <wd_idx<5630>> </P> <P> The Continental Congress printed paper money which was <wd_idx<5640>> so depreciated that it ceased to pass as currency , <wd_idx<5650>> spawning the expression `` not worth a continental '' . <wd_idx<5660>> Congress could not levy taxes and could only make requisitions <wd_idx<5670>> upon the States . Less than a million and a <wd_idx<5680>> half dollars came into the treasury between 1781 and 1784 <wd_idx<5690>> , although the governors had been asked for two million <wd_idx<5700>> in 1783 alone . </P> <P> When", "<wd_idx<5680>> half dollars came into the treasury between 1781 and 1784 <wd_idx<5690>> , although the governors had been asked for two million <wd_idx<5700>> in 1783 alone . </P> <P> When John Adams went <wd_idx<5710>> to London in 1785 as the first representative of the <wd_idx<5720>> United States , he found it impossible to secure a <wd_idx<5730>> treaty for unrestricted commerce . Demands were made for favors <wd_idx<5740>> and there was no assurance that individual states would agree <wd_idx<5750>> to a treaty . Adams stated it was necessary for <wd_idx<5760>> the States to confer the power of passing navigation laws <wd_idx<5770>> to Congress , or that the States themselves pass retaliatory <wd_idx<5780>> acts against Great Britain . Congress had already requested and <wd_idx<5790>> failed to get power over navigation laws . Meanwhile , <wd_idx<5800>> each State acted individually against Great Britain to little effect <wd_idx<5810>> .

State legislatures were unable or <wd_idx<5850>> unwilling to resist attacks upon private contracts and public credit <wd_idx<5860>> .

Congress began the signing process by examining their copy <wd_idx<6080>> of the Articles on June 27 , 1778 . They <wd_idx<6090>> ordered a final copy prepared ( the one in the <wd_idx<6100>> National Archives ) , and that delegates should inform the <wd_idx<6110>> secretary of their authority for ratification . </P> <P> On <wd_idx<6120>> July 9 , 1778 , the prepared copy was ready <wd_idx<6130>> . They dated it , and began to sign . <wd_idx<6140>> They also requested each of the remaining states to notify <wd_idx<6150>> its delegation when ratification was completed . On that date <wd_idx<6160>> , delegates present from New Hampshire , Massachusetts , Rhode <wd_idx<6170>> Island , Connecticut , New York , Pennsylvania , Virginia <wd_idx<6180>> and South Carolina signed the Articles to indicate that their <wd_idx<6190>> states had ratified .

For example , John Wentworth <wd_idx<6250>> of New Hampshire added his name on August 8 . <wd_idx<6260>> John Penn was the first of North Carolina 's delegates <wd_idx<6270>> to arrive ( on July 10 ) , and the <wd_idx<6280>> delegation signed the Articles on July 21 , 1778 . <wd_idx<6290>> </P> <P> The other states had to wait until they <wd_idx<6300>> ratified the Articles and notified their Congressional delegation .

Maryland <wd_idx<6330>> refused to ratify the Articles until every state had ceded <wd_idx<6340>> its western land claims . Chevalier de La Luzerne , <wd_idx<6350>> French Minister to the United States , felt that the <wd_idx<6360>> Articles would help strengthen the American government . In 1780 <wd_idx<6370>> when Maryland requested France provide naval forces in the Chesapeake <wd_idx<6380>> Bay for protection from the British ( who were conducting <wd_idx<6390>> raids in the lower part of the bay ) , <wd_idx<6400>> he indicated that French Admiral Destouches would do what he <wd_idx<6410>> could but La Luzerne also `` sharply pressed '' Maryland <wd_idx<6420>> to ratify the Articles , thus suggesting the two issues <wd_idx<6430>> were related . </P> The Act of the Maryland legislature <wd_idx<6440>> to ratify the Articles of Confederation on February 2 ,", "<wd_idx<6420>> to ratify the Articles , thus suggesting the two issues <wd_idx<6430>> were related . </P> The Act of the Maryland legislature <wd_idx<6440>> to ratify the Articles of Confederation on February 2 , <wd_idx<6450>> 1781 <P> On February 2 , 1781 , the much <wd_idx<6460>> - awaited decision was taken by the Maryland General Assembly <wd_idx<6470>> in Annapolis .

invited all the states to <wd_idx<7270>> send delegates to Annapolis , Maryland to discuss ways to <wd_idx<7280>> reduce interstate conflict . At what came to be known <wd_idx<7290>> as the Annapolis Convention , the few state delegates in <wd_idx<7300>> attendance endorsed a motion that called for all states to <wd_idx<7310>> meet in Philadelphia in May 1787 to discuss ways to <wd_idx<7320>> improve the Articles of Confederation in a `` Grand Convention <wd_idx<7330>> . '' Although the states ' representatives to the Constitutional <wd_idx<7340>> Convention in Philadelphia were only authorized to amend the Articles <wd_idx<7350>> , the representatives held secret , closed - door sessions <wd_idx<7360>> and wrote a new constitution . The new Constitution gave <wd_id", "<wd_idx<7340>> Convention in Philadelphia were only authorized to amend the Articles <wd_idx<7350>> , the representatives held secret , closed - door sessions <wd_idx<7360>> and wrote a new constitution . The new Constitution gave <wd_idx<7370>> much more power to the central government , but characterization <wd_idx<7380>> of the result is disputed . The general goal of <wd_idx<7390>> the authors was to get close to a republic as <wd_idx<7400>> defined by the philosophers of the Age of Enlightenment , <wd_idx<7410>> while trying to address the many difficulties of the interstate <wd_idx<7420>> relationships . Historian Forrest McDonald , using the ideas of <wd_idx<7430>> James Madison from Federalist 39 , describes the change this <wd_idx<7440>> way : </P> <P> The constitutional reallocation of powers created <wd_idx<7450>> a new form of government , unprecedented under the sun <wd_idx<7460>> . Every previous national authority either had been centralized or <wd_idx<7470>> else had been a confederation of sovereign states . The <wd_idx<7480>> new American system was neither one nor the other ; <wd_idx<7490>> it was a mixture of both . </P> <P>", "<wd_idx<7470>> else had been a confederation of sovereign states . The <wd_idx<7480>> new American system was neither one nor the other ; <wd_idx<7490>> it was a mixture of both . </P> <P> In <wd_idx<7500>> May 1786 , Charles Pinckney of South Carolina proposed that <wd_idx<7510>> Congress revise the Articles of Confederation . Recommended changes included <wd_idx<7520>> granting Congress power over foreign and domestic commerce , and <wd_idx<7530>> providing means for Congress to collect money from state treasuries <wd_idx<7540>> . Unanimous approval was necessary to make the alterations , <wd_idx<7550>> however , and Congress failed to reach a consensus . <wd_idx<7560>> The weakness of the Articles in establishing an effective unifying <wd_idx<7570>> government was underscored by the threat of internal conflict both <wd_idx<7580>> within and between the states , especially after Shays ' <wd_idx<7590>> Rebellion threatened to topple the state government of Massachusetts . <wd_idx<7600>> </P> <P> Historian Ralph Ketcham comments on the opinions of <wd_idx<7610>> Patrick Henry , George Mason , and", "<wd_idx<7590>> Rebellion threatened to topple the state government of Massachusetts . <wd_idx<7600>> </P> <P> Historian Ralph Ketcham comments on the opinions of <wd_idx<7610>> Patrick Henry , George Mason , and other Anti-Federalists who <wd_idx<7620>> were not so eager to give up the local autonomy <wd_idx<7630>> won by the revolution : </P> <P> Antifederalists feared what <wd_idx<7640>> Patrick Henry termed the `` consolidated government '' proposed by <wd_idx<7650>> the new Constitution . They saw in Federalist hopes for <wd_idx<7660>> commercial growth and international prestige only the lust of ambitious <wd_idx<7670>> men for a `` splendid empire '' that , in <wd_idx<7680>> the time - honored way of empires , would oppress <wd_idx<7690>> the people with taxes , conscription , and military campaigns <wd_idx<7700>> . Uncertain that any government over so vast a domain <wd_idx<7710>> as the United States could be controlled by the people <wd_idx<7720>> , Antifederalists saw in the enlarged powers of the general <wd_idx<7730>> government only the familiar threats to the rights and liberties ", "<wd_idx<7710>> as the United States could be controlled by the people <wd_idx<7720>> , Antifederalists saw in the enlarged powers of the general <wd_idx<7730>> government only the familiar threats to the rights and liberties <wd_idx<7740>> of the people . </P> <P> Historians have given many <wd_idx<7750>> reasons for the perceived need to replace the articles in <wd_idx<7760>> 1787 . Jillson and Wilson ( 1994 ) point to <wd_idx<7770>> the financial weakness as well as the norms , rules <wd_idx<7780>> and institutional structures of the Congress , and the propensity <wd_idx<7790>> to divide along sectional lines . </P> <P> Rakove ( <wd_idx<7800>> 1988 ) identifies several factors that explain the collapse of <wd_idx<7810>> the Confederation . The lack of compulsory direct taxation power <wd_idx<7820>> was objectionable to those wanting a strong centralized state or <wd_idx<7830>> expecting to benefit from such power . It could not <wd_idx<7840>> collect customs after the war because tariffs were vetoed by <wd_idx<7850>> Rhode Island . Rakove concludes that their failure to implement <wd_", "<wd_idx<7830>> expecting to benefit from such power . It could not <wd_idx<7840>> collect customs after the war because tariffs were vetoed by <wd_idx<7850>> Rhode Island . Rakove concludes that their failure to implement <wd_idx<7860>> national measures `` stemmed not from a heady sense of <wd_idx<7870>> independence but rather from the enormous difficulties that all the <wd_idx<7880>> states encountered in collecting taxes , mustering men , and <wd_idx<7890>> gathering supplies from a war - weary populace . '' <wd_idx<7900>> The second group of factors Rakove identified derived from the <wd_idx<7910>> substantive nature of the problems the Continental Congress confronted after <wd_idx<7920>> 1783 , especially the inability to create a strong foreign <wd_idx<7930>> policy . Finally , the Confederation 's lack of coercive <wd_idx<7940>> power reduced the likelihood for profit to be made by <wd_idx<7950>> political means , thus potential rulers were uninspired to seek <wd_idx<7960>> power . </P> <P> When the war ended in 1783 <wd_idx<7970>> , certain special interests had incentives to create a new <wd_idx<7980>> `` merchant state , '' much like the British", "<wd_idx<7960>> power . </P> <P> When the war ended in 1783 <wd_idx<7970>> , certain special interests had incentives to create a new <wd_idx<7980>> `` merchant state , '' much like the British state <wd_idx<7990>> people had rebelled against . In particular , holders of <wd_idx<8000>> war scrip and land speculators wanted a central government to <wd_idx<8010>> pay off scrip at face value and to legalize western <wd_idx<8020>> land holdings with disputed claims . Also , manufacturers wanted <wd_idx<8030>> a high tariff as a barrier to foreign goods , <wd_idx<8040>> but competition among states made this impossible without a central <wd_idx<8050>> government . </P> <H3> Legitimacy of closing down </H3> <P> <wd_idx<8060>> Political scientist David C. Hendrickson writes that two prominent political <wd_idx<8070>> leaders in the Confederation , John Jay of New York <wd_idx<8080>> and Thomas Burke of North Carolina believed that `` the <wd_idx<8090>> authority of the congress rested on the prior acts of <wd_idx<8100>> the several states , to which the states gave their <wd_id", "<wd_idx<8080>> and Thomas Burke of North Carolina believed that `` the <wd_idx<8090>> authority of the congress rested on the prior acts of <wd_idx<8100>> the several states , to which the states gave their <wd_idx<8110>> voluntary consent , and until those obligations were fulfilled , <wd_idx<8120>> neither nullification of the authority of congress , exercising its <wd_idx<8130>> due powers , nor secession from the compact itself was <wd_idx<8140>> consistent with the terms of their original pledges . '' <wd_idx<8150>> </P> <P> According to Article XIII of the Confederation , <wd_idx<8160>> any alteration had to be approved unanimously : </P> <P> <wd_idx<8170>> ( T ) he Articles of this Confederation shall be <wd_idx<8180>> inviolably observed by every State , and the Union shall <wd_idx<8190>> be perpetual ; nor shall any alteration at any time <wd_idx<8200>> hereafter be made in any of them ; unless such <wd_idx<8210>> alteration be agreed to in a Congress of the United <wd_idx<8220>> States , and be afterwards confirmed by the legislatures of <wd_idx<8230>> every State . </P> <P> On the other hand ,", "<wd_idx<8210>> alteration be agreed to in a Congress of the United <wd_idx<8220>> States , and be afterwards confirmed by the legislatures of <wd_idx<8230>> every State . </P> <P> On the other hand , <wd_idx<8240>> Article VII of the proposed Constitution stated that it would <wd_idx<8250>> become effective after ratification by a mere nine states , <wd_idx<8260>> without unanimity : </P> <P> The Ratification of the Conventions <wd_idx<8270>> of nine States , shall be sufficient for the Establishment <wd_idx<8280>> of this Constitution between the States so ratifying the Same <wd_idx<8290>> . </P> <P> The apparent tension between these two provisions <wd_idx<8300>> was addressed at the time , and remains a topic <wd_idx<8310>> of scholarly discussion . In 1788 , James Madison remarked <wd_idx<8320>> ( in Federalist No. 40 ) that the issue had <wd_idx<8330>> become moot : `` As this objection ... has been <wd_idx<8340>> in a manner waived by those who have criticised the <wd_idx<8350>> powers of the convention , I dismiss it without further <wd_id", "<wd_idx<8330>> become moot : `` As this objection ... has been <wd_idx<8340>> in a manner waived by those who have criticised the <wd_idx<8350>> powers of the convention , I dismiss it without further <wd_idx<8360>> observation . '' Nevertheless , it is an interesting historical <wd_idx<8370>> and legal question whether opponents of the Constitution could have <wd_idx<8380>> plausibly attacked the Constitution on that ground . At the <wd_idx<8390>> time , there were state legislators who argued that the <wd_idx<8400>> Constitution was not an alteration of the Articles of Confederation <wd_idx<8410>> , but rather would be a complete replacement so the <wd_idx<8420>> unanimity rule did not apply . Moreover , the Confederation <wd_idx<8430>> had proven woefully inadequate and therefore was supposedly no longer <wd_idx<8440>> binding . </P> <P> Modern scholars such as Francisco Forrest <wd_idx<8450>> Martin agree that the Articles of Confederation had lost its <wd_idx<8460>> binding force because many states had violated it , and <wd_idx<8470>> thus `` other states - parties did not have to <wd_idx<8480>> comply with the Articles ' unanimous consent rule '' . <wd_id", "<wd_idx<8460>> binding force because many states had violated it , and <wd_idx<8470>> thus `` other states - parties did not have to <wd_idx<8480>> comply with the Articles ' unanimous consent rule '' . <wd_idx<8490>> In contrast , law professor Akhil Amar suggests that there <wd_idx<8500>> may not have really been any conflict between the Articles <wd_idx<8510>> of Confederation and the Constitution on this point ; Article <wd_idx<8520>> VI of the Confederation specifically allowed side deals among states <wd_idx<8530>> , and the Constitution could be viewed as a side <wd_idx<8540>> deal until all states ratified it . </P> <H3> Final <wd_idx<8550>> months </H3> <P> On July 3 , 1788 , the <wd_idx<8560>> Congress received New Hampshire 's all - important ninth ratification <wd_idx<8570>> of the proposed Constitution , thus , according to its <wd_idx<8580>> terms , establishing it as the new framework of governance <wd_idx<8590>> for the ratifying states . The following day delegates considered <wd_idx<8600>> a bill to admit Kentucky into the Union as a <wd_", "<wd_idx<8580>> terms , establishing it as the new framework of governance <wd_idx<8590>> for the ratifying states . The following day delegates considered <wd_idx<8600>> a bill to admit Kentucky into the Union as a <wd_idx<8610>> sovereign state . The discussion ended with Congress making the <wd_idx<8620>> determination that , in light of this development , it <wd_idx<8630>> would be `` unadvisable '' to admit Kentucky into the <wd_idx<8640>> Union , as it could do so `` under the <wd_idx<8650>> Articles of Confederation '' only , but not `` under <wd_idx<8660>> the Constitution '' . </P> <P> By the end of <wd_idx<8670>> July 1788 , 11 of the 13 states had ratified <wd_idx<8680>> the new Constitution . Congress continued to convene under the <wd_idx<8690>> Articles with a quorum until October . On Saturday , <wd_idx<8700>> September 13 , 1788 , the Confederation Congress voted the <wd_idx<8710>> resolve to implement the new Constitution , and on Monday <wd_idx<8720>> , September 15 published an announcement that the new Constitution <wd_idx<8730>> had been ratified by the necessary nine states , set <wd_id", "<wd_idx<8710>> resolve to implement the new Constitution , and on Monday <wd_idx<8720>> , September 15 published an announcement that the new Constitution <wd_idx<8730>> had been ratified by the necessary nine states , set <wd_idx<8740>> the first Wednesday in February 1789 for the presidential electors <wd_idx<8750>> to meet and select a new president , and set <wd_idx<8760>> the first Wednesday of March 1789 as the day the <wd_idx<8770>> new government would take over and the government under the <wd_idx<8780>> Articles of Confederation would come to an end . On <wd_idx<8790>> that same September 13 , it determined that New York <wd_idx<8800>> would remain the national capital . </P> <H2> See also <wd_idx<8810>> </H2> <Ul> <Li> History of the United States ( 1776 <wd_idx<8820>> -- 1789 ) </Li> <Li> Perpetual Union </Li> <Li> Vetocracy <wd_idx<8830>> </Li> <Li> Court of Appeals in Cases of Capture </Li> <wd_idx<8840>> </Ul> <H2> References </H2> <Ol> <Li> Jump up ^ Jensen <wd_idx", "<wd_idx<8830>> </Li> <Li> Court of Appeals in Cases of Capture </Li> <wd_idx<8840>> </Ul> <H2> References </H2> <Ol> <Li> Jump up ^ Jensen <wd_idx<8850>> , Merrill ( 1959 ) .

The Articles of Confederation would bear some resemblance to it . Over the next two decades , some of the basic concepts it addressed would strengthen and others would weaken , particularly the degree of deserved loyalty to the crown . With civil disobedience resulting in coercive , and what the colonials perceived as intolerable acts of Parliament , and armed conflict resulting in dissidents being proclaimed rebels and outside the King 's protection , any loyalty remaining shifted toward independence and how to achieve it . In 1775 , with events outpacing communications , the Second Continental Congress began acting as the provisional government that would run the American Revolutionary War and gain the colonies their collective independence . </P> <P> It was an era of constitution writing -- most states were busy at the task -- and leaders felt the new nation must have a written constitution , even though other nations did not . During the war , Congress exercised an unprecedented level of political , diplomatic , military and economic authority . It adopted trade restrictions , established and maintained an army , issued fiat money , created a military code and negotiated with foreign governments . </P> <P> To transform themselves from outlaws into a legitimate nation , the colonists needed international recognition for their cause and foreign allies to support it . In early 1776 , Thomas Paine argued in the closing pages of the first edition of Common Sense that the `` custom of nations '' demanded a formal declaration of American independence if any European power were to mediate a peace between the Americans and Great Britain . The monarchies of France and Spain in particular could not be expected to aid those they considered rebels against another legitimate monarch . Foreign courts needed to have American grievances laid before them persuasively in a `` manifesto '' which could also reassure them that the Americans would be reliable trading partners . Without such a declaration , Paine concluded , `` ( t ) he custom of all courts is against us , and will be so , until , by an independence , we take rank with other nations . '' </P> <P> Beyond improving their existing association , the records of the Second Continental Congress show that the need for a declaration of independence was intimately linked with the demands of international relations . On June 7 , 1776 , Richard Henry Lee introduced a resolution before the Continental Congress declaring the colonies independent ; at the same time he also urged Congress to resolve `` to take the most effectual measures for forming foreign Alliances '' and to prepare a plan of confederation for the newly independent states . Congress then created three overlapping committees to draft the Declaration , a Model Treaty , and the Articles of Confederation . The Declaration announced the states ' entry into the international system ; the model treaty was designed to establish amity and commerce with other states ; and the Articles of Confederation , which established `` a firm league '' among the thirteen free and independent states , constituted an international agreement to set up central institutions for the conduct of vital domestic and foreign affairs . </P> <H2> Drafting </H2> Articles of Confederation 200th Anniversary commemorative stamp . First issued in York , Pennsylvania. , 1977 <P> On June 12 , 1776 , a day after appointing a committee to prepare a draft of the Declaration of Independence , the Second Continental Congress resolved to appoint a committee of 13 to prepare a draft of a constitution for a union of the states . The committee met repeatedly , and chairman John Dickinson presented their results to the Congress on July 12 , 1776 . There were long debates on such issues as sovereignty , the exact powers to be given the confederate government , whether to have a judiciary , and voting procedures . The final draft of the Articles was prepared in the summer of 1777 and the Second Continental Congress approved them for ratification by the individual states on November 15 , 1777 , after a year of debate . Consensus was achieved by dividing sovereignty between the states and the central government , with a unicameral legislature that protected the liberty of the individual states . </P> <H2> Ratification </H2> <P> The Articles of Confederation was submitted to the states for ratification in November 1777 . The first state to ratify was Virginia on December 16 , 1777 ; 12 states had ratified the Articles by February 1779 , 14 months into the process . The lone holdout , Maryland , refused to go along until the landed states , especially Virginia , had indicated they were prepared to cede their claims west of the Ohio River to the Union . It would be two years before the Maryland General Assembly became satisfied that the various states would follow through , and voted to ratify . During this time , Congress observed the Articles as its de facto frame of government . Maryland finally ratified the Articles on February 2 , 1781 . Congress was informed of Maryland 's assent on March 1 , and officially proclaimed the Articles of Confederation to be the law of the land . </P> <P> The several states ratified the Articles of Confederation on the following dates : </P> <Table> <Tr> <Th_colspan=\"2\"> State </Th> <Th> Date </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 13 ! 1 </Td> <Td> Virginia </Td> <Td> 000000001777 - 12 - 16 - 0000 December 16 , 1777 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 12 ! 2 </Td> <Td> South Carolina </Td> <Td> 000000001778 - 02 - 05 - 0000 February 5 , 1778 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 08 ! 3 </Td> <Td> New York </Td> <Td> 000000001778 - 02 - 06 - 0000 February 6 , 1778 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 11 ! 4 </Td> <Td> Rhode Island </Td> <Td> 000000001778 - 02 - 09 - 0000 February 9 , 1778 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 01 ! 5 </Td> <Td> Connecticut </Td> <Td> 000000001778 - 02 - 12 - 0000 February 12 , 1778 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 03 ! 6 </Td> <Td> Georgia </Td> <Td> 000000001778 - 02 - 26 - 0000 February 26 , 1778 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 06 ! 7 </Td> <Td> New Hampshire </Td> <Td> 000000001778 - 03 - 04 - 0000 March 4 , 1778 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 10 ! 8 </Td> <Td> Pennsylvania </Td> <Td> 000000001778 - 03 - 05 - 0000 March 5 , 1778 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 05 ! 9 </Td> <Td> Massachusetts </Td> <Td> 000000001778 - 03 - 10 - 0000 March 10 , 1778 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 09 ! 10 </Td> <Td> North Carolina </Td> <Td> 000000001778 - 04 - 05 - 0000 April 5 , 1778 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 07 ! 11 </Td> <Td> New Jersey </Td> <Td> 000000001778 - 11 - 19 - 0000 November 19 , 1778 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 02 ! 12 </Td> <Td> Delaware </Td> <Td> 000000001779 - 02 - 01 - 0000 February 1 , 1779 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 04 ! 13 </Td> <Td> Maryland </Td> <Td> 000000001781 - 02 - 02 - 0000 February 2 , 1781 </Td> </Tr> </Table> <H2> Article summaries </H2> <P> The Articles of Confederation contain a preamble , thirteen articles , a conclusion , and a signatory section . The individual articles set the rules for current and future operations of the confederation 's central government . Under the Articles , the states retained sovereignty over all governmental functions not specifically relinquished to the national Congress , which was empowered to make war and peace , negotiate diplomatic and commercial agreements with foreign countries , and to resolve disputes between the states . The document also stipulates that its provisions `` shall be inviolably observed by every state '' and that `` the Union shall be perpetual '' . </P> <P> Summary of the purpose and content of each of the 13 articles : </P> <Ol> <Li> Establishes the name of the confederation with these words : `` The stile of this confederacy shall be ' The United States of America . ' '' </Li> <Li> Asserts the sovereignty of each state , except for the specific powers delegated to the confederation government : `` Each state retains its sovereignty , freedom , and independence , and every power , jurisdiction , and right , which is not by this Confederation expressly delegated . '' </Li> <Li> Declares the purpose of the confederation : `` The said States hereby severally enter into a firm league of friendship with each other , for their common defense , the security of their liberties , and their mutual and general welfare , binding themselves to assist each other , against all force offered to , or attacks made upon them , or any of them , on account of religion , sovereignty , trade , or any other pretense whatever . '' </Li> <Li> Elaborates upon the intent `` to secure and perpetuate mutual friendship and intercourse among the people of the different States in this union , '' and to establish equal treatment and freedom of movement for the free inhabitants of each state to pass unhindered between the states , excluding `` paupers , vagabonds , and fugitives from justice . '' All these people are entitled to equal rights established by the state into which they travel . If a crime is committed in one state and the perpetrator flees to another state , he will be extradited to and tried in the state in which the crime was committed . </Li> <Li> Allocates one vote in the Congress of the Confederation ( the `` United States in Congress Assembled '' ) to each state , which is entitled to a delegation of between two and seven members . Members of Congress are to be appointed by state legislatures . No congressman may serve more than three out of any six years . </Li> <Li> Only the central government may declare war , or conduct foreign political or commercial relations . No state or official may accept foreign gifts or titles , and granting any title of nobility is forbidden to all . No states may form any sub-national groups . No state may tax or interfere with treaty stipulations already proposed . No state may wage war without permission of Congress , unless invaded or under imminent attack on the frontier ; no state may maintain a peacetime standing army or navy , unless infested by pirates , but every State is required to keep ready , a well - trained , disciplined , and equipped militia . </Li> <Li> Whenever an army is raised for common defense , the state legislatures shall assign military ranks of colonel and below . </Li> <Li> Expenditures by the United States of America will be paid with funds raised by state legislatures , and apportioned to the states in proportion to the real property values of each . </Li> <Li> Powers and functions of the United States in Congress Assembled . <Ul> <Li> Grants to the United States in Congress assembled the sole and exclusive right and power to determine peace and war ; to exchange ambassadors ; to enter into treaties and alliances , with some provisos ; to establish rules for deciding all cases of captures or prizes on land or water ; to grant letters of marque and reprisal ( documents authorizing privateers ) in times of peace ; to appoint courts for the trial of pirates and crimes committed on the high seas ; to establish courts for appeals in all cases of captures , but no member of Congress may be appointed a judge ; to set weights and measures ( including coins ) , and for Congress to serve as a final court for disputes between states . </Li> <Li> The court will be composed of jointly appointed commissioners or Congress shall appoint them . Each commissioner is bound by oath to be impartial . The court 's decision is final . </Li> <Li> Congress shall regulate the post offices ; appoint officers in the military ; and regulate the armed forces . </Li> <Li> The United States in Congress assembled may appoint a president who shall not serve longer than one year per three - year term of the Congress . </Li> <Li> Congress may request requisitions ( demands for payments or supplies ) from the states in proportion with their population , or take credit . </Li> <Li> Congress may not declare war , enter into treaties and alliances , appropriate money , or appoint a commander in chief without nine states assented . Congress shall keep a journal of proceedings and adjourn for periods not to exceed six months . </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> When Congress is in recess , any of the powers of Congress may be executed by `` The committee of the states , or any nine of them '' , except for those powers of Congress which require nine states in Congress to execute . </Li> <Li> If `` Canada '' ( as the British - held Province of Quebec was also known ) accedes to this confederation , it will be admitted .

This left the military vulnerable to inadequate funding , supplies , and even food . Further , although the Articles enabled the states to present a unified front when dealing with the European powers , as a tool to build a centralized war - making government , they were largely a failure ; Historian Bruce Chadwick wrote : </P> <P> George Washington had been one of the very first proponents of a strong federal government . The army had nearly disbanded on several occasions during the winters of the war because of the weaknesses of the Continental Congress ... The delegates could not draft soldiers and had to send requests for regular troops and militia to the states . Congress had the right to order the production and purchase of provisions for the soldiers , but could not force anyone to supply them , and the army nearly starved in several winters of war . </P> <P> The Continental Congress , before the Articles were approved , had promised soldiers a pension of half pay for life . However Congress had no power to compel the states to fund this obligation , and as the war wound down after the victory at Yorktown the sense of urgency to support the military was no longer a factor . No progress was made in Congress during the winter of 1783 -- 84 . General Henry Knox , who would later become the first Secretary of War under the Constitution , blamed the weaknesses of the Articles for the inability of the government to fund the army . The army had long been supportive of a strong union . Knox wrote : </P> <P> The army generally have always reprobated the idea of being thirteen armies . Their ardent desires have been to be one continental body looking up to one sovereign ... It is a favorite toast in the army , `` A hoop to the barrel '' or `` Cement to the Union '' . </P> <P> As Congress failed to act on the petitions , Knox wrote to Gouverneur Morris , four years before the Philadelphia Convention was convened , `` As the present Constitution is so defective , why do not you great men call the people together and tell them so ; that is , to have a convention of the States to form a better Constitution . '' </P> <P> Once the war had been won , the Continental Army was largely disbanded . A very small national force was maintained to man the frontier forts and to protect against Native American attacks . Meanwhile , each of the states had an army ( or militia ) , and 11 of them had navies . The wartime promises of bounties and land grants to be paid for service were not being met . In 1783 , George Washington defused the Newburgh conspiracy , but riots by unpaid Pennsylvania veterans forced Congress to leave Philadelphia temporarily . </P> <P> The Congress from time to time during the Revolutionary War requisitioned troops from the states . Any contributions were voluntary , and in the debates of 1788 the Federalists ( who supported the proposed new Constitution ) claimed that state politicians acted unilaterally , and contributed when the Continental army protected their state 's interests . The Anti-Federalists claimed that state politicians understood their duty to the Union and contributed to advance its needs . Dougherty ( 2009 ) concludes that generally the States ' behavior validated the Federalist analysis . This helps explain why the Articles of Confederation needed reforms . </P> <H3> Foreign policy </H3> <P> The 1783 Treaty of Paris , which ended hostilities with Great Britain , languished in Congress for several months because too few delegates were present at any one time to constitute a quorum so that it could be ratified . Afterward , the problem only got worse as Congress had no power to enforce attendance . Rarely did more than half of the roughly sixty delegates attend a session of Congress at the time , causing difficulties in raising a quorum . The resulting paralysis embarrassed and frustrated many American nationalists , including George Washington . Many of the most prominent national leaders , such as Washington , John Adams , John Hancock , and Benjamin Franklin , retired from public life , served as foreign delegates , or held office in state governments ; and for the general public , local government and self - rule seemed quite satisfactory . This served to exacerbate Congress 's impotence . </P> <P> Inherent weaknesses in the confederation 's frame of government also frustrated the ability of the government to conduct foreign policy . In 1786 , Thomas Jefferson , concerned over the failure of Congress to fund an American naval force to confront the Barbary pirates , wrote in a diplomatic correspondence to James Monroe that , `` It will be said there is no money in the treasury . There never will be money in the treasury till the Confederacy shows its teeth . '' </P> <P> Furthermore , the 1786 Jay -- Gardoqui Treaty with Spain also showed weakness in foreign policy . In this treaty , which was never ratified , the United States was to give up rights to use the Mississippi River for 25 years , which would have economically strangled the settlers west of the Appalachian Mountains . Finally , due to the Confederation 's military weakness , it could not compel the British army to leave frontier forts which were on American soil -- forts which , in 1783 , the British promised to leave , but which they delayed leaving pending U.S. implementation of other provisions such as ending action against Loyalists and allowing them to seek compensation . This incomplete British implementation of the Treaty of Paris would later be resolved by the implementation of Jay 's Treaty in 1795 , after the federal Constitution came into force . </P> <H3> Taxation and commerce </H3> <P> Under the Articles of Confederation , the central government 's power was kept quite limited . The Confederation Congress could make decisions , but lacked enforcement powers . Implementation of most decisions , including modifications to the Articles , required unanimous approval of all thirteen state legislatures . </P> <P> Congress was denied any powers of taxation : it could only request money from the states . The states often failed to meet these requests in full , leaving both Congress and the Continental Army chronically short of money . As more money was printed by Congress , the continental dollars depreciated . In 1779 , George Washington wrote to John Jay , who was serving as the president of the Continental Congress , `` that a wagon load of money will scarcely purchase a wagon load of provisions . '' Mr. Jay and the Congress responded in May by requesting $45 million from the States . In an appeal to the States to comply , Jay wrote that the taxes were `` the price of liberty , the peace , and the safety of yourselves and posterity . '' He argued that Americans should avoid having it said `` that America had no sooner become independent than she became insolvent '' or that `` her infant glories and growing fame were obscured and tarnished by broken contracts and violated faith . '' The States did not respond with any of the money requested from them . </P> <P> Congress had also been denied the power to regulate either foreign trade or interstate commerce and , as a result , all of the States maintained control over their own trade policies . The states and the Confederation Congress both incurred large debts during the Revolutionary War , and how to repay those debts became a major issue of debate following the War . Some States paid off their war debts and others did not . Federal assumption of the states ' war debts became a major issue in the deliberations of the Constitutional Convention . </P> <H3> Accomplishments </H3> <Table> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> This section does not cite any sources .

This system represented a sharp break from imperial colonization , as in Europe , and it established the precedent by which the national ( later , federal ) government would be sovereign and expand westward -- as opposed to the existing states doing so under their sovereignty . </P> <P> The Land Ordinance of 1785 established both the general practices of land surveying in the west and northwest and the land ownership provisions used throughout the later westward expansion beyond the Mississippi River . Frontier lands were surveyed into the now - familiar squares of land called the township ( 36 square miles ) , the section ( one square mile ) , and the quarter section ( 160 acres ) . This system was carried forward to most of the States west of the Mississippi ( excluding areas of Texas and California that had already been surveyed and divided up by the Spanish Empire ) . Then , when the Homestead Act was enacted in 1867 , the quarter section became the basic unit of land that was granted to new settler - farmers . </P> <P> The Northwest Ordinance of 1787 noted the agreement of the original states to give up northwestern land claims , organized the Northwest Territory and laid the groundwork for the eventual creation of new states . While it did n't happen under the articles , the land north of the Ohio River and west of the ( present ) western border of Pennsylvania ceded by Massachusetts , Connecticut , New York , Pennsylvania , and Virginia , eventually became the states of : Ohio , Indiana , Illinois , Michigan , and Wisconsin , and the part of Minnesota east of the Mississippi River . The Northwest Ordinance of 1787 also made great advances in the abolition of slavery . New states admitted to the union in this territory would never be slave states . </P> <P> No new states were admitted to the Union under the Articles of Confederation . The Articles provided for a blanket acceptance of the Province of Quebec ( referred to as `` Canada '' in the Articles ) into the United States if it chose to do so . It did not , and the subsequent Constitution carried no such special provision of admission . Additionally , ordinances to admit Frankland ( later modified to Franklin ) , Kentucky , and Vermont to the Union were considered , but none were approved . </P> <H3> Presidents of Congress </H3> Further information : President of the Continental Congress <P> Under the Articles of Confederation , the presiding officer of Congress -- referred to in many official records as President of the United States in Congress Assembled -- chaired the Committee of the States when Congress was in recess , and performed other administrative functions . He was not , however , an executive in the way the later President of the United States is a chief executive , since all of the functions he executed were under the direct control of Congress . </P> <P> There were 10 presidents of Congress under the Articles . The first , Samuel Huntington , had been serving as president of the Continental Congress since September 28 , 1779 . </P> <Table> <Tr> <Th> President </Th> <Th> Term </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Samuel Huntington </Td> <Td> 01 !

The Articles envisioned a permanent confederation , but granted to the Congress -- the only federal institution -- little power to finance itself or to ensure that its resolutions were enforced . There was no president , no executive agencies , no judiciary and no tax base . The absence of a tax base meant that there was no way to pay off state and national debts from the war years except by requesting money from the states , which seldom arrived . Although historians generally agree that the Articles were too weak to hold the fast - growing nation together , they do give credit to the settlement of the western issue , as the states voluntarily turned over their lands to national control . </P> <P> By 1783 , with the end of the British blockade , the new nation was regaining its prosperity . However , trade opportunities were restricted by the mercantilism of the British and French empires . The ports of the British West Indies were closed to all staple products which were not carried in British ships . France and Spain established similar policies . Simultaneously , new manufacturers faced sharp competition from British products which were suddenly available again . Political unrest in several states and efforts by debtors to use popular government to erase their debts increased the anxiety of the political and economic elites which had led the Revolution . The apparent inability of the Congress to redeem the public obligations ( debts ) incurred during the war , or to become a forum for productive cooperation among the states to encourage commerce and economic development , only aggravated a gloomy situation . In 1786 -- 87 , Shays ' Rebellion , an uprising of dissidents in western Massachusetts against the state court system , threatened the stability of state government . </P> <P> The Continental Congress printed paper money which was so depreciated that it ceased to pass as currency , spawning the expression `` not worth a continental '' . Congress could not levy taxes and could only make requisitions upon the States . Less than a million and a half dollars came into the treasury between 1781 and 1784 , although the governors had been asked for two million in 1783 alone . </P> <P> When John Adams went to London in 1785 as the first representative of the United States , he found it impossible to secure a treaty for unrestricted commerce . Demands were made for favors and there was no assurance that individual states would agree to a treaty . Adams stated it was necessary for the States to confer the power of passing navigation laws to Congress , or that the States themselves pass retaliatory acts against Great Britain . Congress had already requested and failed to get power over navigation laws . Meanwhile , each State acted individually against Great Britain to little effect . When other New England states closed their ports to British shipping , Connecticut hastened to profit by opening its ports . </P> <P> By 1787 Congress was unable to protect manufacturing and shipping . State legislatures were unable or unwilling to resist attacks upon private contracts and public credit . Land speculators expected no rise in values when the government could not defend its borders nor protect its frontier population . </P> <P> The idea of a convention to revise the Articles of Confederation grew in favor . Alexander Hamilton realized while serving as Washington 's top aide that a strong central government was necessary to avoid foreign intervention and allay the frustrations due to an ineffectual Congress . Hamilton led a group of like - minded nationalists , won Washington 's endorsement , and convened the Annapolis Convention in 1786 to petition Congress to call a constitutional convention to meet in Philadelphia to remedy the long - term", "reasoning": "The text mentions Alexander Hamilton's efforts to establish a strong central government, highlighting the need for more governmental power under the Articles of Confederation due to the ineffectiveness of Congress.", "id": 17, "begin_index": 540}, {"relevant_content": "pay off scrip at face value and to legalize western land holdings with disputed claims .

Hendrickson writes that two prominent political leaders in the Confederation , John Jay of New York and Thomas Burke of North Carolina believed that `` the authority of the congress rested on the prior acts of the several states , to which the states gave their voluntary consent , and until those obligations were fulfilled , neither nullification of the authority of congress , exercising its due powers , nor secession from the compact itself was consistent with the terms of their original pledges .

An electromyograph detects the electric potential generated by muscle cells when these cells are electrically or neurologically activated . The signals can be analyzed to detect medical abnormalities , activation level , or recruitment order , or to analyze the biomechanics of human or animal movement . </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Medical uses </Li> <Li> 2 Technique <Ul> <Li> 2.1 Skin preparation and risks </Li> <Li> 2.2 Surface and intramuscular EMG recording electrodes </Li> <Li> 2.3 Maximal voluntary contraction </Li> <Li> 2.4 Other measurements </Li> <Li> 2.5 EMG signal decomposition </Li> <Li> 2.6 EMG signal processing </Li> <Li> 2.7 Limitations </Li> <Li> 2.8 Electrical characteristics </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 3 Procedure outcomes <Ul> <Li> 3.1 Normal results </Li> <Li> 3.2 Abnormal results </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 4 History </Li> <Li> 5 Research </Li> <Li> 6 See also </Li> <Li> 7 References </Li> <Li> 8 Further reading </Li> <Li> 9 External links </Li> </Ul> <H2> Medical uses ( edit ) </H2> <P> EMG testing has a variety of clinical and biomedical applications . EMG is used as a diagnostics tool for identifying neuromuscular diseases , or as a research tool for studying kinesiology , and disorders of motor control . EMG signals are sometimes used to guide botulinum toxin or phenol injections into muscles . EMG signals are also used as a control signal for prosthetic devices such as prosthetic hands , arms , and lower limbs . </P> <P> EMG then an acceleromyograph may be used for neuromuscular monitoring in general anesthesia with neuromuscular - blocking drugs , in order to avoid postoperative residual curarization ( PORC ) . </P> <P> Except in the case of some purely primary myopathic conditions EMG is usually performed with another electrodiagnostic medicine test that measures the conducting function of nerves . This is called a nerve conduction studies ( NCS ) . Needle EMG and NCSs are typically indicated when there is pain in the limbs , weakness from spinal nerve compression , or concern about some other neurologic injury or disorder . Spinal nerve injury does not cause neck , mid back pain or low back pain , and for this reason , evidence has not shown EMG or NCS to be helpful in diagnosing causes of axial lumbar pain , thoracic pain , or cervical spine pain . Needle EMG may aid with the diagnosis of nerve compression or injury ( such as carpal tunnel syndrome ) , nerve root injury ( such as sciatica ) , and with other problems of the muscles or nerves . Less common medical conditions include amyotrophic lateral sclerosis , myasthenia gravis , and muscular dystrophy . </P> <H2> Technique ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Skin preparation and risks ( edit ) </H3> <P> The first step before insertion of the needle electrode is skin preparation . This typically involves simply cleaning the skin with an alcohol pad . </P> <P> The actual placement of the needle electrode can be difficult and depends on a number of factors , such as specific muscle selection and the size of that muscle . Proper needle EMG placement is very important for accurate representation of the muscle of interest , although EMG is more effective on superficial muscles as it is unable to bypass the action potentials of superficial muscles and detect deeper muscles . Also , the more body fat an individual has , the weaker the EMG signal . When placing the EMG sensor , the ideal location is at the belly of the muscle : the longitudinal midline . The belly of the muscle can also be thought of as in - between the motor point ( middle ) of the muscle and the tendonus insertion point . </P> <P> Cardiac pacemakers and implanted cardiac defibrillators ( ICDs ) are used increasingly in clinical practice , and no evidence exists indicating that performing routine electrodiagnostic studies on patients with these devices pose a safety hazard . However , there are theoretical concerns that electrical impulses of nerve conduction studies ( NCS ) could be erroneously sensed by devices and result in unintended inhibition or triggering of output or reprogramming of the device . In general , the closer the stimulation site is to the pacemaker and pacing leads , the greater the chance for inducing a voltage of sufficient amplitude to inhibit the pacemaker . Despite such concerns , no immediate or delayed adverse effects have been reported with routine NCS . </P> <P> No known contraindications exist for performing needle EMG or NCS on pregnant patients . Additionally , no complications from these procedures have been reported in the literature . Evoked potential testing , likewise , has not been reported to cause any problems when it is performed during pregnancy . </P> <P> Patients with lymphedema or patients at risk for lymphedema are routinely cautioned to avoid percutaneous procedures in the affected extremity , namely venipuncture , to prevent development or worsening of lymphedema or cellulitis . Despite the potential risk , the evidence for such complications subsequent to venipuncture is limited . No published reports exist of cellulitis , infection , or other complications related to EMG performed in the setting of lymphedema or prior lymph node dissection . However , given the unknown risk of cellulitis in patients with lymphedema , reasonable caution should be exercised in performing needle examinations in lymphedematous regions to avoid complications . In patients with gross edema and taut skin , skin puncture by needle electrodes may result in chronic weeping of serous fluid . The potential bacterial media of such serous fluid and the violation of skin integrity may increase the risk of cellulitis . Before proceeding , the physician should weigh the potential risks of performing the study with the need to obtain the information gained . </P> <H3> Surface and intramuscular EMG recording electrodes ( edit ) </H3> <P> There are two kinds of EMG : surface EMG and intramuscular EMG . Surface EMG assesses muscle function by recording muscle activity from the surface above the muscle on the skin . Surface electrodes are able to provide only a limited assessment of the muscle activity . Surface EMG can be recorded by a pair of electrodes or by a more complex array of multiple electrodes . More than one electrode is needed because EMG recordings display the potential difference ( voltage difference ) between two separate electrodes . Limitations of this approach are the fact that surface electrode recordings are restricted to superficial muscles , are influenced by the depth of the subcutaneous tissue at the site of the recording which can be highly variable depending of the weight of a patient , and can not reliably discriminate between the discharges of adjacent muscles . </P> <P> Intramuscular EMG can be performed using a variety of different types of recording electrodes . The simplest approach is a monopolar needle electrode . This can be a fine wire inserted into a muscle with a surface electrode as a reference ; or two fine wires inserted into muscle referenced to each other . Most commonly fine wire recordings are for research or kinesiology studies . Diagnostic monopolar EMG electrodes are typically insulated and stiff enough to penetrate skin , with only the tip exposed using a surface electrode for reference . Needles for injecting therapeutic botulinum toxin or phenol are typically monopolar electrodes that use a surface reference , in this case , however , the metal shaft of a hypodermic needle , insulated so that only the tip is exposed , is used both to record signals and to inject . Slightly more complex in design is the concentric needle electrode . These needles have a fine wire , embedded in a layer of insulation that fills the barrel of a hypodermic needle , that has an exposed shaft , and the shaft serves as the reference electrode . The exposed tip of the fine wire serves as the active electrode . As a result of this configuration , signals tend to be smaller when recorded from a concentric electrode than when recorded from a monopolar electrode and they are more resistant to electrical artifacts from tissue and measurements tend to be somewhat more reliable . However , because the shaft is exposed throughout its length , superficial muscle activity can contaminate the recording of deeper muscles . Single fiber EMG needle electrodes are designed to have very tiny recording areas , and allow for the discharges of individual muscle fibers to be discriminated . </P> <P> To perform intramuscular EMG , typically either a monopolar or concentric needle electrode is inserted through the skin into the muscle tissue . The needle is then moved to multiple spots within a relaxed muscle to evaluate both insertional activity and resting activity in the muscle . Normal muscles exhibit a brief burst of muscle fiber activation when stimulated by needle movement , but this rarely lasts more than 100ms . The two most common pathologic types of resting activity in muscle are fasciculation and fibrillation potentials . A fasciculation potential is an involuntary activation of a motor unit within the muscle , sometimes visible with the naked eye as a muscle twitch or by surface electrodes . Fibrillations , however , are only detected by needle EMG , and represent the isolated activation of individual muscle fibers , usually as the result of nerve or muscle disease . Often , fibrillations are triggered by needle movement ( insertional activity ) and persist for several seconds or more after the movement ceases . </P> <P> After assessing resting and insertional activity , the electromyographer assess the activity of muscle during voluntary contraction . The shape , size , and frequency of the resulting electrical signals are judged . Then the electrode is retracted a few millimetres , and again the activity is analyzed . This is repeated , sometimes until data on 10 -- 20 motor units have been collected in order to draw conclusions about motor unit function . Each electrode track gives only a very local picture of the activity of the whole muscle . Because skeletal muscles differ in the inner structure , the electrode has to be placed at various locations to obtain an accurate study . </P> <P> Single fiber electromyography assesses the delay between the contractions of individual muscle fibers within a motor unit and is a sensitive test for dysfunction of the neuromuscular junction caused by drugs , poisons , or diseases such as myasthenia gravis . The technique is complicated and typically only performed by individuals with special advanced training . </P> <P> Surface EMG is used in a number of settings ; for example , in the physiotherapy clinic , muscle activation is monitored using surface EMG and patients have an auditory or visual stimulus to help them know when they are activating the muscle ( biofeedback ) . A review of the literature on surface EMG published in 2008 , concluded that surface EMG may be useful to detect the presence of neuromuscular disease ( level C rating , class III data ) , but there are insufficient data to support its utility for distinguishing between neuropathic and myopathic conditions or for the diagnosis of specific neuromuscular diseases . EMGs may be useful for additional study of fatigue associated with post-poliomyelitis syndrome and electromechanical function in myotonic dystrophy ( level C rating , class III data ) . </P> <P> Certain US states limit the performance of needle EMG by nonphysicians . New Jersey declared that it can not be delegated to a physician 's assistant . Michigan has passed legislation saying needle EMG is the practice of medicine . Special training in diagnosing medical diseases with EMG is required only in residency and fellowship programs in neurology , clinical neurophysiology , neuromuscular medicine , and physical medicine and rehabilitation . There are certain subspecialists in otolaryngology who have had selective training in performing EMG of the laryngeal muscles , and subspecialists in urology , obstetrics and gynecology who have had selective training in performing EMG of muscles controlling bowel and bladder function . </P> <H3> Maximal voluntary contraction ( edit ) </H3> <P> One basic function of EMG is to see how well a muscle can be activated . The most common way that can be determined is by performing a maximal voluntary contraction ( MVC ) of the muscle that is being tested . </P> <P> Muscle force , which is measured mechanically , typically correlates highly with measures of EMG activation of muscle . Most commonly this is assessed with surface electrodes , but it should be recognized that these typically only record from muscle fibers in close approximation to the surface . </P> <P> Several analytical methods for determining muscle activation are commonly used depending on the application . The use of mean EMG activation or the peak contraction value is a debated topic . Most studies commonly use the maximal voluntary contraction as a means of analyzing peak force and force generated by target muscles . According to the article , Peak and average rectified EMG measures : Which method of data reduction should be used for assessing core training exercises ? , concluded that the `` average rectified EMG data ( ARV ) is significantly less variable when measuring the muscle activity of the core musculature compared to the peak EMG variable . '' Therefore , these researchers would suggest that `` ARV EMG data should be recorded alongside the peak EMG measure when assessing core exercises . '' Providing the reader with both sets of data would result in enhanced validity of the study and potentially eradicate the contradictions within the research . </P> <H3> Other measurements ( edit ) </H3> <P> EMG can also be used for indicating the amount of fatigue in a muscle . The following changes in the EMG signal can signify muscle fatigue : an increase in the mean absolute value of the signal , increase in the amplitude and duration of the muscle action potential and an overall shift to lower frequencies . Monitoring the changes of different frequency changes the most common way of using EMG to determine levels of fatigue . The lower conduction velocities enable the slower motor neurons to remain active . </P> <P> A motor unit is defined as one motor neuron and all of the muscle fibers it innervates . When a motor unit fires , the impulse ( called an action potential ) is carried down the motor neuron to the muscle . The area where the nerve contacts the muscle is called the neuromuscular junction , or the motor end plate . After the action potential is transmitted across the neuromuscular junction , an action potential is elicited in all of the innervated muscle fibers of that particular motor unit . The sum of all this electrical activity is known as a motor unit action potential ( MUAP ) . This electrophysiologic activity from multiple motor units is the signal typically evaluated during an EMG . The composition of the motor unit , the number of muscle fibres per motor unit , the metabolic type of muscle fibres and many other factors affect the shape of the motor unit potentials in the myogram . </P> <P> Nerve conduction testing is also often done at the same time as an EMG to diagnose neurological diseases . </P> <P> Some patients can find the procedure somewhat painful , whereas others experience only a small amount of discomfort when the needle is inserted . The muscle or muscles being tested may be slightly sore for a day or two after the procedure . </P> <H3> EMG signal decomposition ( edit ) </H3> <P> EMG signals are essentially made up of superimposed motor unit action potentials ( MUAPs ) from several motor units . For a thorough analysis , the measured EMG signals can be decomposed into their constituent MUAPs . MUAPs from different motor units tend to have different characteristic shapes , while MUAPs recorded by the same electrode from the same motor unit are typically similar . Notably MUAP size and shape depend on where the electrode is located with respect to the fibers and so can appear to be different if the electrode moves position . EMG decomposition is non-trivial , although many methods have been proposed . </P> <H3> EMG signal processing ( edit ) </H3> <P> Rectification is the translation of the raw EMG signal to a signal with a single polarity , usually positive . The purpose of rectifying the signal is to ensure the signal does not average to zero , due to the raw EMG signal having positive and negative components . Two types of rectification are used : full - wave and half - wave rectification . Full - wave rectification adds the EMG signal below the baseline to the signal above the baseline to make a conditioned signal that is all positive . If the baseline is zero , this is equivalent to taking the absolute value of the signal . This is the preferred method of rectification because it conserves all of the signal energy for analysis . Half - wave rectification discards the portion of the EMG signal that is below the baseline . In doing so , the average of the data is no longer zero therefore it can be used in statistical analyses . </P> <H3> Limitations ( edit ) </H3> <P> Needle EMG used in clinical settings has practical applications such as helping to discover disease . Needle EMG has limitations , however , in that it does involve voluntary activation of muscle , and as such is less informative in patients unwilling or unable to cooperate , children and infants , and in individuals with paralysis. , Surface EMG can have limited applications due to inherent problems associated with surface EMG . Adipose tissue ( fat ) can affect EMG recordings . Studies show that as adipose tissue increased the active muscle directly below the surface decreased . As adipose tissue increased , the amplitude of the surface EMG signal directly above the center of the active muscle decreased . EMG signal recordings are typically more accurate with individuals who have lower body fat , and more compliant skin , such as young people when compared to old . Muscle cross talk occurs when the EMG signal from one muscle interferes with that of another limiting reliability of the signal of the muscle being tested . Surface EMG is limited due to lack of deep muscles reliability . Deep muscles require intramuscular wires that are intrusive and painful in order to achieve an EMG signal . Surface EMG can only measure superficial muscles and even then it is hard to narrow down the signal to a single muscle . </P> <H3> Electrical characteristics ( edit ) </H3> <P> The electrical source is the muscle membrane potential of about -- 90 mV . Measured EMG potentials range between less than 50 \u03bcV and up to 20 to 30 mV , depending on the muscle under observation . </P> <P> Typical repetition rate of muscle motor unit firing is about 7 -- 20 Hz , depending on the size of the muscle ( eye muscles versus seat ( gluteal ) muscles ) , previous axonal damage and other factors . Damage to motor units can be expected at ranges between 450 and 780 mV . </P> <H2> Procedure outcomes ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Normal results ( edit ) </H3> <P> Muscle tissue at rest is normally electrically inactive . After the electrical activity caused by the irritation of needle insertion subsides , the electromyograph should detect no abnormal spontaneous activity ( i.e. , a muscle at rest should be electrically silent , with the exception of the area of the neuromuscular junction , which is , under normal circumstances , very spontaneously active ) . When the muscle is voluntarily contracted , action potentials begin to appear . As the strength of the muscle contraction is increased , more and more muscle fibers produce action potentials . When the muscle is fully contracted , there should appear a disorderly group of action potentials of varying rates and amplitudes ( a complete recruitment and interference pattern ) . </P> <H3> Abnormal results ( edit ) </H3> <P> EMG findings vary with the type of disorder , the duration of the problem , the age of the patient , the degree to which the patient can be cooperative , the type of needle electrode used to study the patient , and sampling error in terms of the number of areas studied within a single muscle and the number of muscles studied overall . Interpreting EMG findings is usually best done by an individual informed by a focused history and physical examination of the patient , and in conjunction with the results of other relevant diagnostic studies performed including most importantly , nerve conduction studies , but also , where appropriate , imaging studies such as MRI and ultrasound , muscle and nerve biopsy , muscle enzymes , and serologic studies . </P> <P> Abnormal results may be caused by the following medical conditions ( please note this is not an exhaustive list of conditions that can result in abnormal EMG studies ) : </P> <P> </P> <Table> <Tr> <Td> <P> Disorders of Muscle : </P> <Ul> <Li> Inflammatory myopathies </Li> <Li> Polymyositis </Li> <Li> Dermatomyositis </Li> <Li> Inclusion body myopathy </Li> <Li> Myotonia Congenita </Li> <Li> Muscular dystrophies : </Li> <Li> Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy </Li> <Li> Becker muscular dystrophy </Li> <Li> Facioscapulohumeral dystrophy </Li> <Li> Limb girdle muscular dystrophy </Li> <Li> Centronuclear myopathy </Li> <Li> Myotonic dystrophy </Li> <Li> Mitochondrial myopathies </Li> </Ul> <P> Disorders of the neuromuscular junction : </P> <Ul> <Li> Myasthenia Gravis </Li> <Li> Lambert -- Eaton myasthenic syndrome </Li> <Li> Botulism poisoning </Li> <Li> Organophosphate poisoning </Li> <Li> Hypermagnesemia </Li> <Li> Hypocalcemia </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> </Td> <Td> <P> Disorders of Nerves : </P> <Ul> <Li> Carpal tunnel syndrome </Li> <Li> Ulnar neuropathy at the elbow </Li> <Li> Radial nerve palsy ( Saturday night palsy ) </Li> <Li> Peroneal ( fibular ) nerve palsy </Li> <Li> Diabetic neuropathy </Li> <Li> Alcohol related neuropathy </Li> <Li> Nutritional neuropathy </Li> <Li> Amyloid neuropathy </Li> <Li> AIDP </Li> <Li> CIDP </Li> <Li> Bell 's palsy </Li> <Li> Laryngeal neuropathy </Li> <Li> Pudendal neuropathy </Li> <Li> Femoral neuropathy </Li> <Li> Sciatic Neuropathy </Li> <Li> Tibial neuropathy </Li> <Li> Tarsal tunnel syndrome </Li> <Li> Charcot - Marie - Tooth syndrome </Li> <Li> Zoster neuropathy </Li> <Li> Oculomotor , Facial , vagal , trigeminal , glossopharyngeal , spinal accessory neuropathies </Li> <Li> Hemifacial spasm </Li> <Li> Multifocal motor neuropathy </Li> <Li> Axillary neuropathy </Li> <Li> Long thoracic neuropathy </Li> <Li> Suprascapular neuropathy </Li> <Li> Toxic neuropathies </Li> <Li> Drug - induced neuropathies </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> </Td> <Td> <P> Plexus disorders : </P> <Ul> <Li> Neuralgic Amyotrophy ( idiopathic brachial plexitis ) </Li> <Li> Traumatic brachial plexopathy </Li> <Li> Lumbosacral radiculopathy </Li> <Li> Hirayama disease </Li> </Ul> <P> Root disorders : </P> <Ul> <Li> Cervical , thoracic , lumbar , sacral radiculopathy </Li> <Li> Spinal stenosis </Li> <Li> Arachnoiditis </Li> <Li> Leptomeningeal disorders </Li> </Ul> <P> Motor neuron disease </P> <Ul> <Li> Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis </Li> <Li> West Nile virus </Li> <Li> Poliomyelitis </Li> <Li> Kennedy 's syndrome ( Spinobulbar muscular atrophy ) . </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> </Td> </Tr> </Table> <H2> History ( edit ) </H2> <P> The first documented experiments dealing with EMG started with Francesco Redi 's works in 1666 . Redi discovered a highly specialized muscle of the electric ray fish ( Electric Eel ) generated electricity . By 1773 , Walsh had been able to demonstrate that the eel fish 's muscle tissue could generate a spark of electricity . In 1792 , a publication entitled De Viribus Electricitatis in Motu Musculari Commentarius appeared , written by Luigi Galvani , in which the author demonstrated that electricity could initiate muscle contraction . Six decades later , in 1849 , Emil du Bois - Reymond discovered that it was also possible to record electrical activity during a voluntary muscle contraction . The first actual recording of this activity was made by Marey in 1890 , who also introduced the term electromyography . In 1922 , Gasser and Erlanger used an oscilloscope to show the electrical signals from muscles . Because of the stochastic nature of the myoelectric signal , only rough information could be obtained from its observation . The capability of detecting electromyographic signals improved steadily from the 1930s through the 1950s , and researchers began to use improved electrodes more widely for the study of muscles . The AANEM was formed in 1953 as one of several currently active medical societies with a special interest in advancing the science and clinical use of the technique . Clinical use of surface EMG ( sEMG ) for the treatment of more specific disorders began in the 1960s . Hardyck and his researchers were the first ( 1966 ) practitioners to use sEMG . In the early 1980s , Cram and Steger introduced a clinical method for scanning a variety of muscles using an EMG sensing device . </P> <P> It was not until the middle of the 1980s that integration techniques in electrodes had sufficiently advanced to allow batch production of the required small and lightweight instrumentation and amplifiers . At present , a number of suitable amplifiers are commercially available . In the early 1980s , cables that produced signals in the desired microvolt range became available . Recent research has resulted in a better understanding of the properties of surface EMG recording . Surface electromyography is increasingly used for recording from superficial muscles in clinical or kinesiological protocols , where intramuscular electrodes are used for investigating deep muscles or localized muscle activity . </P> <P> There are many applications for the use of EMG . EMG is used clinically for the diagnosis of neurological and neuromuscular problems . It is used diagnostically by gait laboratories and by clinicians trained in the use of biofeedback or ergonomic assessment . EMG is also used in many types of research laboratories , including those involved in biomechanics , motor control , neuromuscular physiology , movement disorders , postural control , and physical therapy . </P> <H2> Research ( edit ) </H2> <P> EMG can be used to sense isometric muscular activity where no movement is produced . This enables definition of a class of subtle motionless gestures to control interfaces without being noticed and without disrupting the surrounding environment . These signals can be used to control a prosthesis or as a control signal for an electronic device such as a mobile phone or PDA . </P> <P> EMG signals have been targeted as control for flight systems . The Human Senses Group at the NASA Ames Research Center at Moffett Field , CA seeks to advance man - machine interfaces by directly connecting a person to a computer . In this project , an EMG signal is used to substitute for mechanical joysticks and keyboards . EMG has also been used in research towards a `` wearable cockpit , '' which employs EMG - based gestures to manipulate switches and control sticks necessary for flight in conjunction with a goggle - based display . </P> <P> Unvoiced speech recognition recognizes speech by observing the EMG activity of muscles associated with speech . It is targeted for use in noisy environments , and may be helpful for people without vocal cords and people with aphasia . </P> <P> EMG has also been used as a control signal for computers and other devices . An interface device based on EMG could be used to control moving objects , such as mobile robots or an electric wheelchair . This may be helpful for individuals that can not operate a joystick - controlled wheelchair . Surface EMG recordings may also be a suitable control signal for some interactive video games . </P> <P> In 1999 an EMG program called Echidna was used to enable a man with locked in syndrome to send a message to a computer . That program , now called NeuroSwitch , developed by Control Bionics enables people with severe disabilities to communicate by text , email , SMS , computer - generated voice and to control computer games and programs , and - through the internet - Anybots telepresence robots . </P> <P> A joint project involving Microsoft , the University of Washington in Seattle , and the University of Toronto in Canada has explored using muscle signals from hand gestures as an interface device . A patent based on this research was submitted on June 26 , 2008 . </P> <H2> See also ( edit ) </H2> <Ul> <Li> Chronaxie </Li> <Li> Compound muscle action potential </Li> <Li> Electrical muscle stimulation </Li> <Li> Electrodiagnostic medicine </Li> <Li> Electromyoneurography </Li> <Li> Magnetomyography </Li> <Li> Nerve conduction study </Li> <Li> Neuromuscular ultrasound </Li> <Li> Phonomyography </Li> </Ul> <H2> References ( edit ) </H2> <Ol> <Li> Jump up ^ Kamen , Gary .

This is called a nerve conduction studies ( <wd_idx<430>> NCS ) . Needle EMG and NCSs are typically indicated <wd_idx<440>> when there is pain in the limbs , weakness from <wd_idx<450>> spinal nerve compression , or concern about some other neurologic <wd_idx<460>> injury or disorder . Spinal nerve injury does not cause <wd_idx<470>> neck , mid back pain or low back pain , <wd_idx<480>> and for this reason , evidence has not shown EMG <wd_idx<490>> or NCS to be helpful in diagnosing causes of axial <wd_idx<500>> lumbar pain , thoracic pain , or cervical spine pain <wd_idx<510>> . Needle EMG may aid with the diagnosis of nerve <wd_idx<520>> compression or injury ( such as carpal tunnel syndrome ) <wd_idx<530>> , nerve root injury ( such as sciatica ) , <wd_idx<540>> and with other problems of the muscles or nerves . <wd_idx<550>> Less common medical conditions include amyotrophic lateral sclerosis , myasthenia", "<wd_idx<530>> , nerve root injury ( such as sciatica ) , <wd_idx<540>> and with other problems of the muscles or nerves . <wd_idx<550>> Less common medical conditions include amyotrophic lateral sclerosis , myasthenia <wd_idx<560>> gravis , and muscular dystrophy . </P> <H2> Technique ( <wd_idx<570>> edit ) </H2> <H3> Skin preparation and risks ( edit <wd_idx<580>> ) </H3> <P> The first step before insertion of the <wd_idx<590>> needle electrode is skin preparation . This typically involves simply <wd_idx<600>> cleaning the skin with an alcohol pad . </P> <P> <wd_idx<610>> The actual placement of the needle electrode can be difficult <wd_idx<620>> and depends on a number of factors , such as <wd_idx<630>> specific muscle selection and the size of that muscle . <wd_idx<640>> Proper needle EMG placement is very important for accurate representation <wd_idx<650>> of the muscle of interest , although EMG is more <wd_idx<660>> effective on superficial muscles as it is unable to bypass <wd_idx<670>> the action potentials of superficial muscles and detect deeper muscles <wd_idx", "<wd_idx<650>> of the muscle of interest , although EMG is more <wd_idx<660>> effective on superficial muscles as it is unable to bypass <wd_idx<670>> the action potentials of superficial muscles and detect deeper muscles <wd_idx<680>> . Also , the more body fat an individual has <wd_idx<690>> , the weaker the EMG signal . When placing the <wd_idx<700>> EMG sensor , the ideal location is at the belly <wd_idx<710>> of the muscle : the longitudinal midline . The belly <wd_idx<720>> of the muscle can also be thought of as in <wd_idx<730>> - between the motor point ( middle ) of the <wd_idx<740>> muscle and the tendonus insertion point . </P> <P> Cardiac <wd_idx<750>> pacemakers and implanted cardiac defibrillators ( ICDs ) are used <wd_idx<760>> increasingly in clinical practice , and no evidence exists indicating <wd_idx<770>> that performing routine electrodiagnostic studies on patients with these devices <wd_idx<780>> pose a safety hazard . However , there are theoretical <wd_idx<790>> concerns that electrical impulses of nerve conduction studies ( NCS <wd_idx<800>> ) could be erroneously sensed by devices and result in <wd_id", "<wd_idx<780>> pose a safety hazard . However , there are theoretical <wd_idx<790>> concerns that electrical impulses of nerve conduction studies ( NCS <wd_idx<800>> ) could be erroneously sensed by devices and result in <wd_idx<810>> unintended inhibition or triggering of output or reprogramming of the <wd_idx<820>> device . In general , the closer the stimulation site <wd_idx<830>> is to the pacemaker and pacing leads , the greater <wd_idx<840>> the chance for inducing a voltage of sufficient amplitude to <wd_idx<850>> inhibit the pacemaker . Despite such concerns , no immediate <wd_idx<860>> or delayed adverse effects have been reported with routine NCS <wd_idx<870>> . </P> <P> No known contraindications exist for performing needle <wd_idx<880>> EMG or NCS on pregnant patients . Additionally , no <wd_idx<890>> complications from these procedures have been reported in the literature <wd_idx<900>> . Evoked potential testing , likewise , has not been <wd_idx<910>> reported to cause any problems when it is performed during <wd_idx<920>> pregnancy . </P> <P> Patients with lymphedema or patients at <wd_idx<930>> risk for lymphedema are routinely cautioned to", "<wd_idx<910>> reported to cause any problems when it is performed during <wd_idx<920>> pregnancy . </P> <P> Patients with lymphedema or patients at <wd_idx<930>> risk for lymphedema are routinely cautioned to avoid percutaneous procedures <wd_idx<940>> in the affected extremity , namely venipuncture , to prevent <wd_idx<950>> development or worsening of lymphedema or cellulitis . Despite the <wd_idx<960>> potential risk , the evidence for such complications subsequent to <wd_idx<970>> venipuncture is limited . No published reports exist of cellulitis <wd_idx<980>> , infection , or other complications related to EMG performed <wd_idx<990>> in the setting of lymphedema or prior lymph node dissection <wd_idx<1000>> .

The potential bacterial media of such serous <wd_idx<1060>> fluid and the violation of skin integrity may increase the <wd_idx<1070>> risk of cellulitis . Before proceeding , the physician should <wd_idx<1080>> weigh the potential risks of performing the study with the <wd_idx<1090>> need to obtain the information gained . </P> <H3> Surface <wd_idx<1100>> and intramuscular EMG recording electrodes ( edit ) </H3> <P> <wd_idx<1110>> There are two kinds of EMG : surface EMG and <wd_idx<1120>> intramuscular EMG . Surface EMG assesses muscle function by recording <wd_idx<1130>> muscle activity from the surface above the muscle on the <wd_idx<1140>> skin . Surface electrodes are able to provide only a <wd_idx<1150>> limited assessment of the muscle activity . Surface EMG can <wd_idx<1160>> be recorded by a pair of electrodes or by a <wd_idx<1170>> more complex array of multiple electrodes . More than one <wd_", "<wd_idx<1150>> limited assessment of the muscle activity . Surface EMG can <wd_idx<1160>> be recorded by a pair of electrodes or by a <wd_idx<1170>> more complex array of multiple electrodes . More than one <wd_idx<1180>> electrode is needed because EMG recordings display the potential difference <wd_idx<1190>> ( voltage difference ) between two separate electrodes . Limitations <wd_idx<1200>> of this approach are the fact that surface electrode recordings <wd_idx<1210>> are restricted to superficial muscles , are influenced by the <wd_idx<1220>> depth of the subcutaneous tissue at the site of the <wd_idx<1230>> recording which can be highly variable depending of the weight <wd_idx<1240>> of a patient , and can not reliably discriminate between <wd_idx<1250>> the discharges of adjacent muscles . </P> <P> Intramuscular EMG <wd_idx<1260>> can be performed using a variety of different types of <wd_idx<1270>> recording electrodes . The simplest approach is a monopolar needle <wd_idx<1280>> electrode . This can be a fine wire inserted into <wd_idx<1290>> a muscle with a surface electrode as a reference ; <wd_", "<wd_idx<1270>> recording electrodes . The simplest approach is a monopolar needle <wd_idx<1280>> electrode . This can be a fine wire inserted into <wd_idx<1290>> a muscle with a surface electrode as a reference ; <wd_idx<1300>> or two fine wires inserted into muscle referenced to each <wd_idx<1310>> other . Most commonly fine wire recordings are for research <wd_idx<1320>> or kinesiology studies . Diagnostic monopolar EMG electrodes are typically <wd_idx<1330>> insulated and stiff enough to penetrate skin , with only <wd_idx<1340>> the tip exposed using a surface electrode for reference . <wd_idx<1350>> Needles for injecting therapeutic botulinum toxin or phenol are typically <wd_idx<1360>> monopolar electrodes that use a surface reference , in this <wd_idx<1370>> case , however , the metal shaft of a hypodermic <wd_idx<1380>> needle , insulated so that only the tip is exposed <wd_idx<1390>> , is used both to record signals and to inject <wd_idx<1400>> . Slightly more complex in design is the concentric needle <wd_idx<1410>> electrode . These needles have a fine wire , embedded <wd_", "<wd_idx<1390>> , is used both to record signals and to inject <wd_idx<1400>> . Slightly more complex in design is the concentric needle <wd_idx<1410>> electrode . These needles have a fine wire , embedded <wd_idx<1420>> in a layer of insulation that fills the barrel of <wd_idx<1430>> a hypodermic needle , that has an exposed shaft , <wd_idx<1440>> and the shaft serves as the reference electrode . The <wd_idx<1450>> exposed tip of the fine wire serves as the active <wd_idx<1460>> electrode . As a result of this configuration , signals <wd_idx<1470>> tend to be smaller when recorded from a concentric electrode <wd_idx<1480>> than when recorded from a monopolar electrode and they are <wd_idx<1490>> more resistant to electrical artifacts from tissue and measurements tend <wd_idx<1500>> to be somewhat more reliable . However , because the <wd_idx<1510>> shaft is exposed throughout its length , superficial muscle activity <wd_idx<1520>> can contaminate the recording of deeper muscles . Single fiber <wd_idx<1530>> EMG needle electrodes are designed to have very tiny recording <wd_idx<1540>> areas , and allow for the discharges of individual muscle ", "<wd_idx<1520>> can contaminate the recording of deeper muscles . Single fiber <wd_idx<1530>> EMG needle electrodes are designed to have very tiny recording <wd_idx<1540>> areas , and allow for the discharges of individual muscle <wd_idx<1550>> fibers to be discriminated . </P> <P> To perform intramuscular <wd_idx<1560>> EMG , typically either a monopolar or concentric needle electrode <wd_idx<1570>> is inserted through the skin into the muscle tissue . <wd_idx<1580>> The needle is then moved to multiple spots within a <wd_idx<1590>> relaxed muscle to evaluate both insertional activity and resting activity <wd_idx<1600>> in the muscle . Normal muscles exhibit a brief burst <wd_idx<1610>> of muscle fiber activation when stimulated by needle movement , <wd_idx<1620>> but this rarely lasts more than 100ms . The two <wd_idx<1630>> most common pathologic types of resting activity in muscle are <wd_idx<1640>> fasciculation and fibrillation potentials . A fasciculation potential is an <wd_idx<1650>> involuntary activation of a motor unit within the muscle , <wd_idx<1660>> sometimes visible with the naked eye as", "<wd_idx<1640>> fasciculation and fibrillation potentials . A fasciculation potential is an <wd_idx<1650>> involuntary activation of a motor unit within the muscle , <wd_idx<1660>> sometimes visible with the naked eye as a muscle twitch <wd_idx<1670>> or by surface electrodes . Fibrillations , however , are <wd_idx<1680>> only detected by needle EMG , and represent the isolated <wd_idx<1690>> activation of individual muscle fibers , usually as the result <wd_idx<1700>> of nerve or muscle disease . Often , fibrillations are <wd_idx<1710>> triggered by needle movement ( insertional activity ) and persist <wd_idx<1720>> for several seconds or more after the movement ceases . <wd_idx<1730>> </P> <P> After assessing resting and insertional activity , the <wd_idx<1740>> electromyographer assess the activity of muscle during voluntary contraction . <wd_idx<1750>> The shape , size , and frequency of the resulting <wd_idx<1760>> electrical signals are judged . Then the electrode is retracted <wd_idx<1770>> a few millimetres , and again the activity is analyzed <wd_idx<1780>> . This is repeated , sometimes until data on 10 <wd", "<wd_idx<1760>> electrical signals are judged . Then the electrode is retracted <wd_idx<1770>> a few millimetres , and again the activity is analyzed <wd_idx<1780>> . This is repeated , sometimes until data on 10 <wd_idx<1790>> -- 20 motor units have been collected in order to <wd_idx<1800>> draw conclusions about motor unit function . Each electrode track <wd_idx<1810>> gives only a very local picture of the activity of <wd_idx<1820>> the whole muscle . Because skeletal muscles differ in the <wd_idx<1830>> inner structure , the electrode has to be placed at <wd_idx<1840>> various locations to obtain an accurate study . </P> <P> <wd_idx<1850>> Single fiber electromyography assesses the delay between the contractions of <wd_idx<1860>> individual muscle fibers within a motor unit and is a <wd_idx<1870>> sensitive test for dysfunction of the neuromuscular junction caused by <wd_idx<1880>> drugs , poisons , or diseases such as myasthenia gravis <wd_idx<1890>> .

A review of the literature <wd_idx<1960>> on surface EMG published in 2008 , concluded that surface <wd_idx<1970>> EMG may be useful to detect the presence of neuromuscular <wd_idx<1980>> disease ( level C rating , class III data ) <wd_idx<1990>> , but there are insufficient data to support its utility <wd_idx<2000>> for distinguishing between neuropathic and myopathic conditions or for the <wd_idx<2010>> diagnosis of specific neuromuscular diseases .

New <wd_idx<2060>> Jersey declared that it can not be delegated to a <wd_idx<2070>> physician 's assistant . Michigan has passed legislation saying needle <wd_idx<2080>> EMG is the practice of medicine . Special training in <wd_idx<2090>> diagnosing medical diseases with EMG is required only in residency <wd_idx<2100>> and fellowship programs in neurology , clinical neurophysiology , neuromuscular <wd_idx<2110>> medicine , and physical medicine and rehabilitation . There are <wd_idx<2120>> certain subspecialists in otolaryngology who have had selective training in <wd_idx<2130>> performing EMG of the laryngeal muscles , and subspecialists in <wd_idx<2140>> urology", "<wd_idx<2120>> certain subspecialists in otolaryngology who have had selective training in <wd_idx<2130>> performing EMG of the laryngeal muscles , and subspecialists in <wd_idx<2140>> urology , obstetrics and gynecology who have had selective training <wd_idx<2150>> in performing EMG of muscles controlling bowel and bladder function <wd_idx<2160>> . </P> <H3> Maximal voluntary contraction ( edit ) </H3> <wd_idx<2170>> <P> One basic function of EMG is to see how <wd_idx<2180>> well a muscle can be activated . The most common <wd_idx<2190>> way that can be determined is by performing a maximal <wd_idx<2200>> voluntary contraction ( MVC ) of the muscle that is <wd_idx<2210>> being tested . </P> <P> Muscle force , which is <wd_idx<2220>> measured mechanically , typically correlates highly with measures of EMG <wd_idx<2230>> activation of muscle . Most commonly this is assessed with <wd_idx<2240>> surface electrodes , but it should be recognized that these <wd_idx<2250>> typically only record from muscle fibers in close approximation to <wd_id", "<wd_idx<2230>> activation of muscle . Most commonly this is assessed with <wd_idx<2240>> surface electrodes , but it should be recognized that these <wd_idx<2250>> typically only record from muscle fibers in close approximation to <wd_idx<2260>> the surface . </P> <P> Several analytical methods for determining <wd_idx<2270>> muscle activation are commonly used depending on the application . <wd_idx<2280>> The use of mean EMG activation or the peak contraction <wd_idx<2290>> value is a debated topic . Most studies commonly use <wd_idx<2300>> the maximal voluntary contraction as a means of analyzing peak <wd_idx<2310>> force and force generated by target muscles . According to <wd_idx<2320>> the article , Peak and average rectified EMG measures : <wd_idx<2330>> Which method of data reduction should be used for assessing <wd_idx<2340>> core training exercises ? , concluded that the `` average <wd_idx<2350>> rectified EMG data ( ARV ) is significantly less variable <wd_idx<2360>> when measuring the muscle activity of the core musculature compared <wd_idx<2370>> to the peak EMG variable . '' Therefore , these <wd_idx<2380>> researchers would suggest that `` ARV EMG data should", "<wd_idx<2360>> when measuring the muscle activity of the core musculature compared <wd_idx<2370>> to the peak EMG variable . '' Therefore , these <wd_idx<2380>> researchers would suggest that `` ARV EMG data should be <wd_idx<2390>> recorded alongside the peak EMG measure when assessing core exercises <wd_idx<2400>> . '' Providing the reader with both sets of data <wd_idx<2410>> would result in enhanced validity of the study and potentially <wd_idx<2420>> eradicate the contradictions within the research . </P> <H3> Other <wd_idx<2430>> measurements ( edit ) </H3> <P> EMG can also be <wd_idx<2440>> used for indicating the amount of fatigue in a muscle <wd_idx<2450>> . The following changes in the EMG signal can signify <wd_idx<2460>> muscle fatigue : an increase in the mean absolute value <wd_idx<2470>> of the signal , increase in the amplitude and duration <wd_idx<2480>> of the muscle action potential and an overall shift to <wd_idx<2490>> lower frequencies . Monitoring the changes of different frequency changes <wd_idx<2500>> the most common way of using EMG to determine levels <wd_id", "<wd_idx<2480>> of the muscle action potential and an overall shift to <wd_idx<2490>> lower frequencies . Monitoring the changes of different frequency changes <wd_idx<2500>> the most common way of using EMG to determine levels <wd_idx<2510>> of fatigue . The lower conduction velocities enable the slower <wd_idx<2520>> motor neurons to remain active . </P> <P> A motor <wd_idx<2530>> unit is defined as one motor neuron and all of <wd_idx<2540>> the muscle fibers it innervates . When a motor unit <wd_idx<2550>> fires , the impulse ( called an action potential ) <wd_idx<2560>> is carried down the motor neuron to the muscle . <wd_idx<2570>> The area where the nerve contacts the muscle is called <wd_idx<2580>> the neuromuscular junction , or the motor end plate . <wd_idx<2590>> After the action potential is transmitted across the neuromuscular junction <wd_idx<2600>> , an action potential is elicited in all of the <wd_idx<2610>> innervated muscle fibers of that particular motor unit . The <wd_idx<2620>> sum of all this electrical activity is known as a ", "<wd_idx<2600>> , an action potential is elicited in all of the <wd_idx<2610>> innervated muscle fibers of that particular motor unit . The <wd_idx<2620>> sum of all this electrical activity is known as a <wd_idx<2630>> motor unit action potential ( MUAP ) . This electrophysiologic <wd_idx<2640>> activity from multiple motor units is the signal typically evaluated <wd_idx<2650>> during an EMG . The composition of the motor unit <wd_idx<2660>> , the number of muscle fibres per motor unit , <wd_idx<2670>> the metabolic type of muscle fibres and many other factors <wd_idx<2680>> affect the shape of the motor unit potentials in the <wd_idx<2690>> myogram . </P> <P> Nerve conduction testing is also often <wd_idx<2700>> done at the same time as an EMG to diagnose <wd_idx<2710>> neurological diseases . </P> <P> Some patients can find the <wd_idx<2720>> procedure somewhat painful , whereas others experience only a small <wd_idx<2730>> amount of discomfort when the needle is inserted .

For a <wd_idx<2790>> thorough analysis , the measured EMG signals can be decomposed <wd_idx<2800>> into their constituent MUAPs . MUAPs from different motor units <wd_idx<2810>> tend to have different characteristic shapes , while MUAPs recorded <wd_idx<2820>> by the same electrode from the same motor unit are <wd_idx<2830>> typically similar . Notably MUAP size and shape depend on <wd_idx<2840>> where the electrode is located with respect to the fibers <wd_idx<2850>> and so can appear to be different if the electrode <wd_idx<2860>> moves position .

EMG decomposition is non-trivial , although many <wd_idx<2870>> methods have been proposed . </P> <H3> EMG signal processing <wd_idx<2880>> ( edit ) </H3> <P> Rectification is the translation of <wd_idx<2890>> the raw EMG signal to a signal with a single <wd_idx<2900>> polarity , usually positive . The purpose of rectifying the <wd_idx<2910>> signal is to ensure the signal does not average to <wd_idx<2920>> zero , due to the raw EMG signal having positive <wd_idx<2930>> and negative components . Two types of rectification are used <wd_idx<2940>> : full - wave and half - wave rectification . <wd_idx<2950>> Full - wave rectification adds the EMG signal below the <wd_idx<2960>> baseline to the signal above the baseline to make a <wd_idx<2970>> conditioned signal that is all positive . If the baseline <wd_idx<2980>> is zero , this is equivalent to taking the absolute <wd_id", "<wd_idx<2960>> baseline to the signal above the baseline to make a <wd_idx<2970>> conditioned signal that is all positive . If the baseline <wd_idx<2980>> is zero , this is equivalent to taking the absolute <wd_idx<2990>> value of the signal . This is the preferred method <wd_idx<3000>> of rectification because it conserves all of the signal energy <wd_idx<3010>> for analysis . Half - wave rectification discards the portion <wd_idx<3020>> of the EMG signal that is below the baseline . <wd_idx<3030>> In doing so , the average of the data is <wd_idx<3040>> no longer zero therefore it can be used in statistical <wd_idx<3050>> analyses . </P> <H3> Limitations ( edit ) </H3> <P> <wd_idx<3060>> Needle EMG used in clinical settings has practical applications such <wd_idx<3070>> as helping to discover disease . Needle EMG has limitations <wd_idx<3080>> , however , in that it does involve voluntary activation <wd_idx<3090>> of muscle , and as such is less informative in <wd_idx<3100>> patients unwilling or unable to cooperate , children and infants <wd_id", "<wd_idx<3080>> , however , in that it does involve voluntary activation <wd_idx<3090>> of muscle , and as such is less informative in <wd_idx<3100>> patients unwilling or unable to cooperate , children and infants <wd_idx<3110>> , and in individuals with paralysis. , Surface EMG can <wd_idx<3120>> have limited applications due to inherent problems associated with surface <wd_idx<3130>> EMG . Adipose tissue ( fat ) can affect EMG <wd_idx<3140>> recordings . Studies show that as adipose tissue increased the <wd_idx<3150>> active muscle directly below the surface decreased . As adipose <wd_idx<3160>> tissue increased , the amplitude of the surface EMG signal <wd_idx<3170>> directly above the center of the active muscle decreased . <wd_idx<3180>> EMG signal recordings are typically more accurate with individuals who <wd_idx<3190>> have lower body fat , and more compliant skin , <wd_idx<3200>> such as young people when compared to old .

Surface EMG is limited <wd_idx<3240>> due to lack of deep muscles reliability . Deep muscles <wd_idx<3250>> require intramuscular wires that are intrusive and painful in order <wd_idx<3260>> to achieve an EMG signal .

By 1773 , <wd_idx<4110>> Walsh had been able to demonstrate that the eel fish <wd_idx<4120>> 's muscle tissue could generate a spark of electricity . <wd_idx<4130>> In 1792 , a publication entitled De Viribus Electricitatis in <wd_idx<4140>> Motu Musculari Commentarius appeared , written by Luigi Galvani , <wd_idx<4150>> in which the author demonstrated that electricity could initiate muscle <wd_idx<4160>> contraction . Six decades later , in 1849 , Emil <wd_idx<4170>> du Bois - Reymond discovered that it was also possible <wd_idx<4180>> to record electrical activity during a voluntary muscle contraction . <wd_idx<4190>> The first actual recording of this activity was made by <wd_idx<4200>> Marey in 1890 , who also introduced the term electromyography <wd_idx<4210>> .

Because of <wd_idx<4230>> the stochastic nature of the myoelectric signal , only rough <wd_idx<4240>> information could be obtained from its observation . The capability <wd_idx<4250>> of detecting electromyographic signals improved steadily from the 1930s through <wd_idx<4260>> the 1950s , and researchers began to use improved electrodes <wd_idx<4270>> more widely for the study of muscles . The AANEM <wd_idx<4280>> was formed in 1953 as one of several currently active <wd_idx<4290>> medical societies with a special interest in advancing the science <wd_idx<4300>> and clinical use of the technique . Clinical use of <wd_idx<4310>> surface EMG ( sEMG ) for the treatment of more <wd_idx<4320>> specific disorders began in the 1960s .

At <wd_idx<4400>> present , a number of suitable amplifiers are commercially available <wd_idx<4410>> . In the early 1980s , cables that produced signals <wd_idx<4420>> in the desired microvolt range became available . Recent research <wd_idx<4430>> has resulted in a better understanding of the properties of <wd_idx<4440>> surface EMG recording .

Animated map of the Roman Republic and Empire between 510 BCE and 530 CE Republic Empire Eastern / Byzantine Empire Western Empire <P> The Fall of the Western Roman Empire ( also called Fall of the Roman Empire or Fall of Rome ) was the process of decline in the Western Roman Empire in which it failed to enforce its rule , and its vast territory was divided into several successor polities . The Roman Empire lost the strengths that had allowed it to exercise effective control ; modern historians mention factors including the effectiveness and numbers of the army , the health and numbers of the Roman population , the strength of the economy , the competence of the Emperor , the religious changes of the period , and the efficiency of the civil administration . Increasing pressure from barbarians outside Roman culture also contributed greatly to the collapse . The reasons for the collapse are major subjects of the historiography of the ancient world and they inform much modern discourse on state failure . </P> <P> Relevant dates include 117 CE , when the Empire was at its greatest territorial extent , and the accession of Diocletian in 284 . Irreversible major territorial loss , however , began in 376 with a large - scale irruption of Goths and others . In 395 , after winning two destructive civil wars , Theodosius I died , leaving a collapsing field army and the Empire , still plagued by Goths , divided between his two incapable sons . By 476 when Odoacer deposed the Emperor Romulus , the Western Roman Emperor wielded negligible military , political , or financial power and had no effective control over the scattered Western domains that could still be described as Roman . Invading barbarians had established their own power in most of the area of the Western Empire . While its legitimacy lasted for centuries longer and its cultural influence remains today , the Western Empire never had the strength to rise again . </P> <P> The Fall is not the only unifying concept for these events ; the period described as Late Antiquity emphasizes the cultural continuities throughout and beyond the political collapse . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Historical approaches <Ul> <Li> 1.1 Timespan </Li> <Li> 1.2 Reasons </Li> <Li> 1.3 Alternative descriptions and labels </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 2 Height of power , crises , and recoveries <Ul> <Li> 2.1 Height of power </Li> <Li> 2.2 Crisis of the Third Century </Li> <Li> 2.3 Reunification and political division </Li> <Li> 2.4 Growing social divisions </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 3 313 -- 376 : Abuse of power , frontier warfare , and rise of Christianity </Li> <Li> 4 376 -- 395 ; invasions , civil wars , and religious discord <Ul> <Li> 4.1 Battle of Adrianople </Li> <Li> 4.2 Partial recovery in the Balkans </Li> <Li> 4.3 Civil wars </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 5 Military , financial , and political ineffectiveness : the process of failure </Li> <Li> 6 395 -- 406 ; Stilicho <Ul> <Li> 6.1 Stilicho 's attempts to unify the Empire , revolts , and invasions </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 7 408 -- 410 ; the end of an effective regular field army , starvation in Italy , sack of Rome <Ul> <Li> 7.1 Stilicho 's fall and Alaric 's reaction </Li> <Li> 7.2 Alaric besieges Rome </Li> <Li> 7.3 The Goths move out of Italy </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 8 405 -- 418 in the Gallic provinces ; barbarians and usurpers , loss of Britannia , partial loss of Hispania and Gaul <Ul> <Li> 8.1 Settlement of 418 ; barbarians within the empire </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 9 421 -- 433 ; renewed dissension after the death of Constantius , partial loss of the Diocese of Africa </Li> <Li> 10 433 -- 454 ; ascendancy of Aetius , loss of Carthage <Ul> <Li> 10.1 444 -- 453 ; attacks by the empire of Attila the Hun </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 11 455 -- 456 ; failure of Avitus , further losses in Gaul , rise of Ricimer </Li> <Li> 12 457 -- 467 ; resurgence under Majorian , attempt to recover Africa , control by Ricimer </Li> <Li> 13 467 -- 472 , Anthemius ; an Emperor and an army from the East </Li> <Li> 14 472 -- 476 ; the final emperors , puppets of the warlords </Li> <Li> 15 From 476 ; last Emperor , rump states </Li> <Li> 16 Legacy </Li> <Li> 17 See also </Li> <Li> 18 Notes </Li> <Li> 19 References </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> Historical approaches ( edit ) </H2> Main article : Historiography of the fall of the Western Roman Empire <P> Since 1776 , when Edward Gibbon published the first volume of his The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire , Decline and Fall has been the theme around which much of the history of the Roman Empire has been structured . `` From the eighteenth century onward , '' historian Glen Bowersock wrote , `` we have been obsessed with the fall : it has been valued as an archetype for every perceived decline , and , hence , as a symbol for our own fears . '' The Fall is not the only unifying concept for these events ; the period described as Late Antiquity emphasizes the cultural continuities throughout and beyond the political collapse . </P> <H3> Timespan ( edit ) </H3> <P> The Fall of the Western Roman Empire was the process of decline in the Western Roman Empire in which it failed to enforce its rule . The loss of centralized political control over the West , and the lessened power of the East , are universally agreed , but the theme of decline has been taken to cover a much wider time span than the hundred years from 376 . For Cassius Dio , the accession of the emperor Commodus in 180 CE marked the descent `` from a kingdom of gold to one of rust and iron '' . Gibbon started his story in 98 and Theodor Mommsen regarded the whole of the imperial period as unworthy of inclusion in his Nobel Prize - winning History of Rome . Arnold J. Toynbee and James Burke argue that the entire Imperial era was one of steady decay of institutions founded in republican times . As one convenient marker for the end , 476 has been used since Gibbon , but other markers include the Crisis of the Third Century , the Crossing of the Rhine in 406 ( or 405 ) , the sack of Rome in 410 , the death of Julius Nepos in 480 , all the way to the Fall of New Rome in 1453 . </P> <H3> Reasons ( edit ) </H3> <P> Gibbon gave a classic formulation of reasons why the Fall happened . He began an ongoing controversy about the role of Christianity , but he gave great weight to other causes of internal decline and to attacks from outside the Empire . </P> <P> The story of its ruin is simple and obvious ; and , instead of inquiring why the Roman empire was destroyed , we should rather be surprised that it had subsisted so long . The victorious legions , who , in distant wars , acquired the vices of strangers and mercenaries , first oppressed the freedom of the republic , and afterwards violated the majesty of the purple . The emperors , anxious for their personal safety and the public peace , were reduced to the base expedient of corrupting the discipline which rendered them alike formidable to their sovereign and to the enemy ; the vigour of the military government was relaxed , and finally dissolved , by the partial institutions of Constantine ; and the Roman world was overwhelmed by a deluge of Barbarians . </P> -- Edward Gibbon . The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire , `` General Observations on the Fall of the Roman Empire in the West '' , Chapter 38 <P> Alexander Demandt enumerated 210 different theories on why Rome fell , and new ideas have emerged since . Historians still try to analyze the reasons for loss of political control over a vast territory ( and , as a subsidiary theme , the reasons for the survival of the Eastern Roman Empire ) . Comparison has also been made with China after the end of the Han dynasty , which re-established unity under the Sui dynasty while the Mediterranean world remained politically disunited . </P> <P> Low taxes helped the Roman aristocracy increase their wealth , which equalled or exceeded the revenues of the central government . An emperor sometimes replenished his treasury by confiscating the estates of the `` super-rich '' , but in the later period , the resistance of the wealthy to paying taxes was one of the factors contributing to the collapse of the Empire . </P> <H3> Alternative descriptions and labels ( edit ) </H3> Main article : Late Antiquity <P> From at least the time of Henri Pirenne scholars have described a continuity of Roman culture and political legitimacy long after 476 . Pirenne postponed the demise of classical civilization to the 8th century . He challenged the notion that Germanic barbarians had caused the Western Roman Empire to end , and he refused to equate the end of the Western Roman Empire with the end of the office of emperor in Italy . He pointed out the essential continuity of the economy of the Roman Mediterranean even after the barbarian invasions , and suggested that only the Muslim conquests represented a decisive break with antiquity . The more recent formulation of a historical period characterized as `` Late Antiquity '' emphasizes the transformations of ancient to medieval worlds within a cultural continuity . In recent decades archaeologically - based argument even extends the continuity in material culture and in patterns of settlement as late as the eleventh century . Observing the political reality of lost control , but also the cultural and archaeological continuities , the process has been described as a complex cultural transformation , rather than a fall . </P> <H2> Height of power , crises , and recoveries ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Height of power ( edit ) </H3> <P> The Roman Empire reached its greatest geographical extent under Trajan ( emperor 98 -- 117 ) , who ruled a prosperous state that stretched from Armenia to the Atlantic . The Empire had large numbers of trained , supplied , and disciplined soldiers , as well as a comprehensive civil administration based in thriving cities with effective control over public finances . Among its literate elite it had ideological legitimacy as the only worthwhile form of civilization and a cultural unity based on comprehensive familiarity with Greek and Roman literature and rhetoric . The Empire 's power allowed it to maintain extreme differences of wealth and status ( including slavery on a large scale ) , and its wide - ranging trade networks permitted even modest households to use goods made by professionals far away . </P> <P> Its financial system allowed it to raise significant taxes which , despite endemic corruption , supported a large regular army with logistics and training . The cursus honorum , a standardized series of military and civil posts organised for ambitious aristocratic men , ensured that powerful noblemen became familiar with military and civil command and administration . At a lower level within the army , connecting the aristocrats at the top with the private soldiers , a large number of centurions were well - rewarded , literate , and responsible for training , discipline , administration , and leadership in battle . City governments with their own properties and revenues functioned effectively at a local level ; membership of city councils involved lucrative opportunities for independent decision - making , and , despite its obligations , became seen as a privilege . Under a series of emperors who each adopted a mature and capable successor , the Empire did not require civil wars to regulate the imperial succession . Requests could be submitted directly to the better emperors , and the answers had the force of law , putting the imperial power directly in touch with even humble subjects . The cults of polytheist religion were hugely varied , but none claimed that theirs was the only truth , and their followers displayed mutual tolerance , producing a polyphonous religious harmony . Religious strife was rare after the suppression of the Bar Kokhba revolt in 136 ( after which the devastated Judaea ceased to be a major centre for Jewish unrest ) . Heavy mortality in 165 -- 180 from the Antonine Plague seriously impaired attempts to repel Germanic invaders , but the legions generally held or at least speedily re-instated the borders of the Empire . </P> Map of the Roman Empire in the early second century <H3> Crisis of the third century ( edit ) </H3> Main article : Crisis of the Third Century <P> The Empire suffered from multiple , serious crises during the third century , including the rise of the Sassanid Empire , which inflicted three crushing defeats on Roman field armies and remained a potent threat for centuries . Other disasters included repeated civil wars , barbarian invasions , and more mass mortality in the Plague of Cyprian ( from 250 onwards ) . Rome abandoned the province of Dacia on the north of the Danube ( 271 ) , and for a short period the Empire split into a Gallic Empire in the West ( 260 -- 274 ) , a Palmyrene Empire in the East ( 260 -- 273 ) , and a central Roman rump state . The Rhine / Danube frontier also came under more effective threat from larger barbarian groupings , which had developed better agriculture and larger populations . The Empire survived the Crisis of the Third Century , directing its economy successfully towards defence , but survival came at the price of a more centralized and bureaucratic state . Under Gallienus the senatorial aristocracy ceased joining the ranks of the senior military commanders , its typical members lacking interest in military service and showing incompetence at command . </P> The divided Empire in 271 CE <H3> Reunification and political division ( edit ) </H3> <P> Aurelian reunited the empire in 274 ; and from 284 Diocletian and his successors reorganized it with more emphasis on the military . John the Lydian , writing over two centuries later , reported that Diocletian 's army at one point totaled 389,704 men , plus 45,562 in the fleets , and numbers may have increased later . With the limited communications of the time , both the European and the Eastern frontiers needed the attention of their own supreme commanders . Diocletian tried to solve this problem by re-establishing an adoptive succession with a senior ( Augustus ) and junior ( Caesar ) emperor in each half of the Empire , but this system of tetrarchy broke down within one generation ; the hereditary principle re-established itself with generally unfortunate results , and thereafter civil war became again the main method of establishing new imperial regimes . Although Constantine the Great ( in office 306 to 337 ) again re-united the Empire , towards the end of the fourth century the need for division was generally accepted . From then on , the Empire existed in constant tension between the need for two emperors and their mutual mistrust . </P> <P> Until late in the fourth century the united Empire retained sufficient power to launch attacks against its enemies in Germania and in the Sassanid Empire . Receptio of barbarians became widely practiced : imperial authorities admitted potentially hostile groups into the Empire , split them up , and allotted to them lands , status , and duties within the imperial system . In this way many groups provided unfree workers ( coloni ) for Roman landowners , and recruits ( laeti ) for the Roman army . Sometimes their leaders became officers . Normally the Romans managed the process carefully , with sufficient military force on hand to ensure compliance , and cultural assimilation followed over the next generation or two . </P> Map of the Roman Empire under the Tetrarchy , showing the dioceses and the four Tetrarchs ' zones of responsibility <H3> Growing social divisions ( edit ) </H3> <P> The new supreme rulers disposed of the legal fiction of the early Empire ( seeing the emperor as but the first among equals ) ; emperors from Aurelian ( reigned 270 -- 275 ) onwards openly styled themselves as dominus et deus , `` lord and god '' , titles appropriate for a master - slave relationship . An elaborate court ceremonial developed , and obsequious flattery became the order of the day . Under Diocletian , the flow of direct requests to the emperor rapidly reduced and soon ceased altogether . No other form of direct access replaced them , and the emperor received only information filtered through his courtiers . </P> <P> Official cruelty , supporting extortion and corruption , may also have become more commonplace . While the scale , complexity , and violence of government were unmatched , the emperors lost control over their whole realm insofar as that control came increasingly to be wielded by anyone who paid for it . Meanwhile , the richest senatorial families , immune from most taxation , engrossed more and more of the available wealth and income , while also becoming divorced from any tradition of military excellence . One scholar identifies a great increase in the purchasing power of gold , two and a half fold from 274 to the later fourth century , which may be an index of growing economic inequality between a gold - rich elite and a cash - poor peasantry . </P> <P> Within the late Roman military , many recruits and even officers had barbarian origins , and soldiers are recorded as using possibly - barbarian rituals such as elevating a claimant on shields . Some scholars have seen this as an indication of weakness ; others disagree , seeing neither barbarian recruits nor new rituals as causing any problem with the effectiveness or loyalty of the army . </P> <H2> 313 -- 376 : abuse of power , frontier warfare , and rise of Christianity ( edit ) </H2> Further information : History of late ancient Christianity <P> In 313 Constantine I declared official toleration of Christianity , followed over the ensuing decades by establishment of Christian orthodoxy and by official and private action against pagans and non-orthodox Christians . His successors generally continued this process , and Christianity became the religion of any ambitious civil official . Under Constantine the cities lost their revenue from local taxes , and under Constantius II ( r . 337 -- 361 ) their endowments of property . This worsened the existing difficulty in keeping the city councils up to strength , and the services provided by the cities were scamped or abandoned . Public building projects became fewer , more often repairs than new construction , and now provided at state expense rather than by local grandees wishing to consolidate long - term local influence . A further financial abuse was Constantius 's increased habit of granting to his immediate entourage the estates of persons condemned of treason and other capital charges ; this reduced future though not immediate income , and those close to the emperor gained a strong incentive to stimulate his suspicion of plots . </P> <P> Constantine settled Franks on the lower left bank of the Rhine ; their settlements required a line of fortifications to keep them in check , indicating that Rome had lost almost all local control . Under Constantius , bandits came to dominate areas such as Isauria well within the empire . The tribes of Germany also became more populous and more threatening . In Gaul , which did not really recover from the invasions of the third century , there was widespread insecurity and economic decline in the 300s , perhaps worst in Armorica . By 350 , after decades of pirate attacks , virtually all villas in Armorica were deserted , and local use of money ceased about 360 . Repeated attempts to economize on military expenditure included billeting troops in cities , where they could less easily be kept under military discipline and could more easily extort from civilians . Except in the rare case of a determined and incorruptible general , these troops proved ineffective in action and dangerous to civilians . Frontier troops were often given land rather than pay ; as they farmed for themselves , their direct costs diminished , but so did their effectiveness , and there was much less economic stimulus to the frontier economy . However , except for the provinces along the lower Rhine , the agricultural economy was generally doing well . The average nutritional state of the population in the West suffered a serious decline in the late second century ; the population of North - Western Europe did not recover , though the Mediterranean regions did . </P> <P> The numbers and effectiveness of the regular soldiers may have declined during the fourth century : payrolls were inflated so that pay could be diverted and exemptions from duty sold , their opportunities for personal extortion were multiplied by residence in cities , and their effectiveness was reduced by concentration on extortion instead of drill . However , extortion , gross corruption , and occasional ineffectiveness were not new to the Roman army ; there is no consensus whether its effectiveness significantly declined before 376 . Ammianus Marcellinus , himself a professional soldier , repeats longstanding observations about the superiority of contemporary Roman armies being due to training and discipline , not to physical size or strength . Despite a possible decrease in its ability to assemble and supply large armies , Rome maintained an aggressive and potent stance against perceived threats almost to the end of the fourth century . </P> Solidus of Julian , c. 361 . Obverse : Julian with the beard appropriate to a Neoplatonic philosopher . Inscription : FL ( AVIVS ) CL ( AVDIVS ) IVLIANVS PP ( = Pater Patriae , `` father of the nation '' ) AVG ( = Augustus ) . Reverse : an armed Roman , military standard in one hand , a captive in the other . Inscription : VIRTVS EXERCITVS ROMANORVM , `` the bravery / virtue of the Roman army '' ; the mint mark is SIRM , Sirmium <P> Julian ( r . 360 -- 363 ) launched a drive against official corruption which allowed the tax demands in Gaul to be reduced to one - third of their previous amount , while all government requirements were still met . In civil legislation Julian was notable for his pro-pagan policies . All Christian sects were officially tolerated by Julian , persecution of heretics was forbidden , and non-Christian religions were encouraged . Some Christians continued to destroy temples , disrupt rituals , and break sacred images , seeking martyrdom and at times achieving it at the hands of non-Christian mobs or secular authorities ; some pagans attacked the Christians who had previously been involved with the destruction of temples . </P> <P> Julian won victories against Germans who had invaded Gaul . He launched an expensive campaign against the Persians , which ended in defeat and his own death . He succeeded in marching to the Sassanid capital of Ctesiphon , but lacked adequate supplies for an assault . He burned his boats and supplies to show resolve in continuing operations , but the Sassanids began a war of attrition by burning crops . Finding himself cut off in enemy territory , he began a land retreat during which he was mortally wounded . His successor Jovian , acclaimed by a demoralized army , began his brief reign ( 363 -- 364 ) trapped in Mesopotamia without supplies . To purchase safe passage home , he had to concede areas of northern Mesopotamia and Kurdistan , including the strategically important fortress of Nisibis , which had been Roman since before the Peace of Nisibis in 299 . </P> <P> The brothers Valens ( r . 364 -- 378 ) and Valentinian I ( r . 364 -- 375 ) energetically tackled the threats of barbarian attacks on all the Western frontiers and tried to alleviate the burdens of taxation , which had risen continuously over the previous forty years ; Valens in the East reduced the tax demand by half in his fourth year . </P> <P> Both were Christians and confiscated the temple lands that Julian had restored , but were generally tolerant of other beliefs . Valentinian in the West refused to intervene in religious controversy ; in the East , Valens had to deal with Christians who did not conform to his ideas of orthodoxy , and persecution formed part of his response . The wealth of the church increased dramatically , immense resources both public and private being used for ecclesiastical construction and support of the religious life . Bishops in wealthy cities were thus able to offer vast patronage ; Ammianus described some as `` enriched from the offerings of matrons , ride seated in carriages , wearing clothing chosen with care , and serve banquets so lavish that their entertainments outdo the tables of kings '' . Edward Gibbon remarked that `` the soldiers ' pay was lavished on the useless multitudes of both sexes who could only plead the merits of abstinence and chastity '' , though there are no figures for the monks and nuns nor for their maintenance costs . Pagan rituals and buildings had not been cheap either ; the move to Christianity may not have had significant effects on the public finances . Some public disorder also followed competition for prestigious posts ; Pope Damasus I was installed in 366 after an election whose casualties included a hundred and thirty - seven corpses in the basilica of Sicininus . </P> <P> Valentinian died of an apoplexy while personally shouting at envoys of Germanic leaders . His successors in the West were children , his sons Gratian ( r . 375 -- 383 ) and Valentinian II ( r . 375 -- 392 ) . Gratian , `` alien from the art of government both by temperament and by training '' removed the Altar of Victory from the Senate House , and he rejected the pagan title of Pontifex Maximus . </P> <H2> 376 -- 395 ; invasions , civil wars , and religious discord ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Battle of Adrianople ( edit ) </H3> <P> In 376 the East faced an enormous barbarian influx across the Danube , mostly Goths who were refugees from the Huns . They were exploited by corrupt officials rather than effectively resettled , and they took up arms , joined by more Goths and by some Alans and Huns . Valens was in Asia with his main field army , preparing for an assault on the Persians , and redirecting the army and its logistic support would have required time . Gratian 's armies were distracted by Germanic invasions across the Rhine . In 378 Valens attacked the invaders with the Eastern field army , perhaps some 20,000 men -- possibly only 10 % of the soldiers nominally available in the Danube provinces -- and in the Battle of Adrianople , 9 August 378 , he lost much of that army and his own life . All of the Balkan provinces were thus exposed to raiding , without effective response from the remaining garrisons who were `` more easily slaughtered than sheep '' . Cities were able to hold their own walls against barbarians who had no siege equipment , and they generally remained intact although the countryside suffered . </P> <H3> Partial recovery in the Balkans ( edit ) </H3> <P> Gratian appointed a new Augustus , a proven general from Hispania called Theodosius . During the next four years , he partially re-established the Roman position in the East . These campaigns depended on effective imperial coordination and mutual trust -- between 379 and 380 Theodosius controlled not only the Eastern empire , but also , by agreement , the diocese of Illyricum . Theodosius was unable to recruit enough Roman troops , relying on barbarian warbands without Roman military discipline or loyalty . In contrast , during the Cimbrian War , the Roman Republic , controlling a smaller area than the western Empire , had been able to reconstitute large regular armies of citizens after greater defeats than Adrianople , and it ended that war with the near - extermination of the invading barbarian supergroups , each recorded as having more than 100,000 warriors ( with allowances for the usual exaggeration of numbers by ancient authors ) . Theodosius 's partial failure may have stimulated Vegetius to offer advice on re-forming an effective army ( the advice may date from the 390s or from the 430s ) : </P> <P> From the foundation of the city till the reign of the Emperor Gratian , the foot wore cuirasses and helmets . But negligence and sloth having by degrees introduced a total relaxation of discipline , the soldiers began to think their armor too heavy , as they seldom put it on . They first requested leave from the Emperor to lay aside the cuirass and afterwards the helmet . In consequence of this , our troops in their engagements with the Goths were often overwhelmed with their showers of arrows . Nor was the necessity of obliging the infantry to resume their cuirasses and helmets discovered , notwithstanding such repeated defeats , which brought on the destruction of so many great cities . Troops , defenseless and exposed to all the weapons of the enemy , are more disposed to fly than fight . What can be expected from a foot - archer without cuirass or helmet , who can not hold at once his bow and shield ; or from the ensigns whose bodies are naked , and who can not at the same time carry a shield and the colors ? The foot soldier finds the weight of a cuirass and even of a helmet intolerable . This is because he is so seldom exercised and rarely puts them on . </P> <P> The final Gothic settlement was acclaimed with relief , even the official panegyrist admitting that these Goths could not be expelled or exterminated , nor reduced to unfree status . Instead they were either recruited into the imperial forces , or settled in the devastated provinces along the south bank of the Danube , where the regular garrisons were never fully re-established . In some later accounts , and widely in recent work , this is regarded as a treaty settlement , the first time that barbarians were given a home within the Empire in which they retained their political and military cohesion . No formal treaty is recorded , nor details of whatever agreement was actually made , and when `` the Goths '' re-emerge in our records they have different leaders and are soldiers of a sort . In 391 Alaric , a Gothic leader , rebelled against Roman control . Goths attacked the emperor himself , but within a year Alaric was accepted as a leader of Theodosius 's Gothic troops and this rebellion was over . </P> <P> Theodosius 's financial position must have been difficult , since he had to pay for expensive campaigning from a reduced tax base . The business of subduing barbarian warbands also demanded substantial gifts of precious metal . Nevertheless , he is represented as financially lavish , though personally frugal when on campaign . At least one extra levy provoked desperation and rioting in which the emperor 's statues were destroyed . He was pious , a Nicene Christian heavily influenced by Ambrose , and implacable against heretics . In 392 he forbade even private honor to the gods , and pagan rituals such as the Olympic Games . He either ordered or connived at the widespread destruction of sacred buildings . </P> <H3> Civil wars ( edit ) </H3> <P> Theodosius had to face a powerful usurper in the West ; Magnus Maximus declared himself Emperor in 383 , stripped troops from the outlying regions of Britannia ( probably replacing some with federate chieftains and their war - bands ) and invaded Gaul . His troops killed Gratian and he was accepted as Augustus in the Gallic provinces , where he was responsible for the first official executions of Christian heretics . To compensate the Western court for the loss of Gaul , Hispania , and Britannia , Theodosius ceded the diocese of Dacia and the diocese of Macedonia to their control . In 387 Maximus invaded Italy , forcing Valentinian II to flee to the East , where he accepted Nicene Christianity . Maximus boasted to Ambrose of the numbers of barbarians in his forces , and hordes of Goths , Huns , and Alans followed Theodosius . Maximus negotiated with Theodosius for acceptance as Augustus of the West , but Theodosius refused , gathered his armies , and counterattacked , winning the civil war in 388 . There were heavy troop losses on both sides of the conflict . Later Welsh legend has Maximus 's defeated troops resettled in Armorica , instead of returning to Britannia , and by 400 , Armorica was controlled by Bagaudae rather than by imperial authority . </P> <P> Theodosius restored Valentinian II , still a very young man , as Augustus in the West . He also appointed Arbogast , a pagan general of Frankish origin , as Valentinian 's commander - in - chief and guardian . Valentinian quarreled in public with Arbogast , failed to assert any authority , and died , either by suicide or by murder , at the age of 21 . Arbogast and Theodosius failed to come to terms and Arbogast nominated an imperial official , Eugenius ( r . 392 -- 394 ) , as emperor in the West . Eugenius made some modest attempts to win pagan support , and with Arbogast led a large army to fight another destructive civil war . They were defeated and killed at the Battle of the Frigidus , which was attended by further heavy losses especially among the Gothic federates of Theodosius . The north - eastern approaches to Italy were never effectively garrisoned again . </P> The Eastern and Western Roman Empire at the death of Theodosius I in 395 <P> Theodosius died a few months later in early 395 , leaving his young sons Honorius ( r . 395 -- 423 ) and Arcadius ( r . 395 -- 408 ) as emperors . In the immediate aftermath of Theodosius 's death , the magister militum Stilicho , married to Theodosius 's niece , asserted himself in the West as the guardian of Honorius and commander of the remains of the defeated Western army . He also claimed control over Arcadius in Constantinople , but Rufinus , magister officiorum on the spot , had already established his own power there . Henceforward the Empire was not under the control of one man , until much of the West had been permanently lost . Neither Honorius nor Arcadius ever displayed any ability either as rulers or as generals , and both lived as the puppets of their courts . Stilicho tried to reunite the Eastern and Western courts under his personal control , but in doing so achieved only the continued hostility of all of Arcadius 's successive supreme ministers . </P> <H2> Military , financial , and political ineffectiveness : the process of failure ( edit ) </H2> <P> The ineffectiveness of Roman military responses from Stilicho onwards has been described as `` shocking '' , with little evidence of indigenous field forces or of adequate training , discipline , pay , or supply for the barbarians who formed most of the available troops . Local defence was occasionally effective , but was often associated with withdrawal from central control and taxes ; in many areas , barbarians under Roman authority attacked culturally - Roman `` Bagaudae '' . </P> <P> Corruption , in this context the diversion of public finance from the needs of the army , may have contributed greatly to the Fall . The rich senatorial aristocrats in Rome itself became increasingly influential during the fifth century ; they supported armed strength in theory , but did not wish to pay for it or to offer their own workers as army recruits . They did , however , pass large amounts of money to the Christian Church . At a local level , from the early fourth century , the town councils lost their property and their power , which often became concentrated in the hands of a few local despots beyond the reach of the law . </P> <P> The fifth - century Western emperors , with brief exceptions , were individuals incapable of ruling effectively or even of controlling their own courts . Those exceptions were responsible for brief , but remarkable resurgences of Roman power . </P> <H2> 395 -- 406 ; Stilicho ( edit ) </H2> The emperor Honorius , a contemporary depiction on a consular diptych issued by Anicius Petronius Probus to celebrate Probus 's consulship in 406 , now in the Aosta museum <P> Without an authoritative ruler , the Balkan provinces fell rapidly into disorder . Alaric was disappointed in his hopes for promotion to magister militum after the battle of the Frigidus . He again led Gothic tribesmen in arms and established himself as an independent power , burning the countryside as far as the walls of Constantinople . Alaric 's ambitions for long - term Roman office were never quite acceptable to the Roman imperial courts , and his men could never settle long enough to farm in any one area . They showed no inclination to leave the Empire and face the Huns from whom they had fled in 376 ; indeed the Huns were still stirring up further migrations which often ended by attacking Rome in turn . Alaric 's group was never destroyed nor expelled from the Empire , nor acculturated under effective Roman domination . </P> <H3> Stilicho 's attempts to unify the Empire , revolts , and invasions ( edit ) </H3> <P> Stilicho moved with his remaining mobile forces into Greece , a clear threat to Rufinus ' control of the Eastern empire . The bulk of Rufinus ' forces were occupied with Hunnic incursions in Asia Minor and Syria , leaving Thrace undefended . He opted to enlist Alaric and his men , and sent them to Thessaly to stave off Stilicho 's threat , which they did . No battle took place . Stilicho was forced to send some of his Eastern forces home . They went to Constantinople under the command of one Gainas , a Goth with a large Gothic following . On arrival , Gainas murdered Rufinus , and was appointed magister militum for Thrace by Eutropius , the new supreme minister and the only eunuch consul of Rome , who controlled Arcadius `` as if he were a sheep '' . Stilicho obtained a few more troops from the German frontier and continued to campaign ineffectively against the Eastern empire ; again he was successfully opposed by Alaric and his men . During the next year , 397 , Eutropius personally led his troops to victory over some Huns who were marauding in Asia Minor . With his position thus strengthened he declared Stilicho a public enemy , and he established Alaric as magister militum per Illyricum . A poem by Synesius advises the emperor to display manliness and remove a `` skin - clad savage '' ( probably Alaric ) from the councils of power and his barbarians from the Roman army . We do not know if Arcadius ever became aware of the existence of this advice , but it had no recorded effect . Synesius , from a province suffering the widespread ravages of a few poor but greedy barbarians , also complained of `` the peacetime war , one almost worse than the barbarian war and arising from military indiscipline and the officer 's greed . '' </P> The Favorites of the Emperor Honorius , by John William Waterhouse , 1883 <P> The magister militum in the Diocese of Africa declared for the East and stopped the supply of grain to Rome . Italy had not fed itself for centuries and could not do so now . In 398 , Stilicho sent his last reserves , a few thousand men , to re-take the Diocese of Africa , and he strengthened his position further when he married his daughter Maria to Honorius . Throughout this period Stilicho , and all other generals , were desperately short of recruits and supplies for them . In 400 , Stilicho was charged to press into service any `` laetus , Alamannus , Sarmatian , vagrant , son of a veteran '' or any other person liable to serve . He had reached the bottom of his recruitment pool . Though personally not corrupt , he was very active in confiscating assets ; the financial and administrative machine was not producing enough support for the army . </P> An ivory diptych , thought to depict Stilicho ( right ) with his wife Serena and son Eucherius , ca . 395 ( Monza Cathedral ) <P> In 399 , Tribigild 's rebellion in Asia Minor allowed Gainas to accumulate a significant army ( mostly Goths ) , become supreme in the Eastern court , and execute Eutropius . He now felt that he could dispense with Alaric 's services and he nominally transferred Alaric 's province to the West . This administrative change removed Alaric 's Roman rank and his entitlement to legal provisioning for his men , leaving his army -- the only significant force in the ravaged Balkans -- as a problem for Stilicho . In 400 , the citizens of Constantinople revolted against Gainas and massacred as many of his people , soldiers and their families , as they could catch . Some Goths at least built rafts and tried to cross the strip of sea that separates Asia from Europe ; the Roman navy slaughtered them . By the beginning of 401 , Gainas ' head rode a pike through Constantinople while another Gothic general became consul . Meanwhile , groups of Huns started a series of attacks across the Danube , and the Isaurians marauded far and wide in Anatolia . </P> <P> In 401 Stilicho travelled over the Alps to Raetia , to scrape up further troops . He left the Rhine defended only by the `` dread '' of Roman retaliation , rather than by adequate forces able to take the field . Early in spring , Alaric , probably desperate , invaded Italy , and he drove Honorius westward from Mediolanum , besieging him in Hasta Pompeia in Liguria . Stilicho returned as soon as the passes had cleared , meeting Alaric in two battles ( near Pollentia and Verona ) without decisive results . The Goths , weakened , were allowed to retreat back to Illyricum where the Western court again gave Alaric office , though only as comes and only over Dalmatia and Pannonia Secunda rather than the whole of Illyricum . Stilicho probably supposed that this pact would allow him to put Italian government into order and recruit fresh troops . He may also have planned with Alaric 's help to relaunch his attempts to gain control over the Eastern court . </P> Christian pendant of Empress Maria , daughter of Stilicho , and wife of Honorius . Mus\u00e9e du Louvre . The pendant reads , around a central cross ( clockwise ) : HONORI MARIA SERHNA VIVATIS STELICHO . The letters form a Christogram <P> However , in 405 , Stilicho was distracted by a fresh invasion of Northern Italy . Another group of Goths fleeing the Huns , led by one Radagaisus , devastated the north of Italy for six months before Stilicho could muster enough forces to take the field against them . Stilicho recalled troops from Britannia and the depth of the crisis was shown when he urged all Roman soldiers to allow their personal slaves to fight beside them . His forces , including Hun and Alan auxiliaries , may in the end have totalled rather less than 15,000 men . Radagaisus was defeated and executed . 12,000 prisoners from the defeated horde were drafted into Stilicho 's service . Stilicho continued negotiations with Alaric ; Flavius Aetius , son of one of Stilicho 's major supporters , was sent as a hostage to Alaric in 405 . In 406 Stilicho , hearing of new invaders and rebels who had appeared in the northern provinces , insisted on making peace with Alaric , probably on the basis that Alaric would prepare to move either against the Eastern court or against the rebels in Gaul . The Senate deeply resented peace with Alaric ; in 407 , when Alaric marched into Noricum and demanded a large payment for his expensive efforts in Stilicho 's interests , the senate , `` inspired by the courage , rather than the wisdom , of their predecessors , '' preferred war . One senator famously declaimed Non est ista pax , sed pactio servitutis ( `` This is not peace , but a pact of servitude '' ) . Stilicho paid Alaric four thousand pounds of gold nevertheless . Stilicho sent Sarus , a Gothic general , over the Alps to face the usurper Constantine III , but he lost and barely escaped , having to leave his baggage to the bandits who now infested the Alpine passes . </P> <P> The empress Maria , daughter of Stilicho , died in 407 or early 408 and her sister Aemilia Materna Thermantia married Honorius . In the East , Arcadius died on 1 May 408 and was replaced by his son Theodosius II ; Stilicho seems to have planned to march to Constantinople , and to install there a regime loyal to himself . He may also have intended to give Alaric a senior official position and send him against the rebels in Gaul . Before he could do so , while he was away at Ticinum at the head of a small detachment , a bloody coup against his supporters took place at Honorius 's court . It was led by Stilicho 's own creature , one Olympius . </P> <H2> 408 -- 410 ; the end of an effective regular field army , starvation in Italy , sack of Rome ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Stilicho 's Fall and Alaric 's reaction ( edit ) </H3> <P> Stilicho had news of the coup at Bononia ( where he was probably waiting for Alaric ) . His small escort of barbarians was led by Sarus , who rebelled . His Gothic troops massacred the Hun contingent in their sleep , and then withdrew towards the cities in which their families were billeted . Stilicho ordered that these troops should not be admitted , but , now without an army , he was forced to flee for sanctuary , promised his life , and killed . </P> <P> Alaric was again declared an enemy of the Emperor . The conspiracy then massacred the families of the federate troops ( as presumed supporters of Stilicho , although they had probably rebelled against him ) , and the troops defected en masse to Alaric . The conspirators seem to have let their main army disintegrate , and had no policy except hunting down supporters of Stilicho . Italy was left without effective indigenous defence forces thereafter . Heraclianus , a co-conspirator of Olympius , became governor of the Diocese of Africa , where he controlled the source of most of Italy 's grain , and he supplied food only in the interests of Honorius 's regime . </P> <P> As a declared ' enemy of the Emperor ' , Alaric was denied the legitimacy that he needed to collect taxes and hold cities without large garrisons , which he could not afford to detach . He again offered to move his men , this time to Pannonia , in exchange for a modest sum of money and the modest title of Comes , but he was refused as a supporter of Stilicho . He moved into Italy , probably using the route and supplies arranged for him by Stilicho , bypassing the imperial court in Ravenna which was protected by widespread marshland and had a port , and he menaced the city of Rome itself . In 407 , there was no equivalent of the determined response to the catastrophic Battle of Cannae in 216 BCE , when the entire Roman population , even slaves , had been mobilized to resist the enemy . </P> <P> Alaric 's military operations centred on the port of Rome , through which Rome 's grain supply had to pass . Alaric 's first siege of Rome in 408 caused dreadful famine within the walls . It was ended by a payment that , though large , was less than one of the richest senators could have produced . The super-rich aristocrats made little contribution ; pagan temples were stripped of ornaments to make up the total . With promises of freedom , Alaric also recruited many of the slaves in Rome . </P> <P> Alaric withdrew to Tuscany and recruited more slaves . Ataulf , a Goth nominally in Roman service and brother - in - law to Alaric , marched through Italy to join Alaric despite taking casualties from a small force of Hunnic mercenaries led by Olympius . Sarus was an enemy of Ataulf , and on Ataulf 's arrival went back into imperial service . </P> <H3> Alaric besieges Rome ( edit ) </H3> <P> In 409 Olympius fell to further intrigue , having his ears cut off before he was beaten to death . Alaric tried again to negotiate with Honorius , but his demands ( now even more moderate , only frontier land and food ) were inflated by the messenger and Honorius responded with insults , which were reported verbatim to Alaric . He broke off negotiations and the standoff continued . Honorius 's court made overtures to the usurper Constantine III in Gaul and arranged to bring Hunnic forces into Italy , Alaric ravaged Italy outside the fortified cities ( which he could not garrison ) , and the Romans refused open battle ( for which they had inadequate forces ) . Late in the year Alaric sent bishops to express his readiness to leave Italy if Honorius would only grant his people a supply of grain . Honorius , sensing weakness , flatly refused . </P> <P> Alaric moved to Rome and captured Galla Placidia , sister of Honorius . The Senate in Rome , despite its loathing for Alaric , was now desperate enough to give him almost anything he wanted . They had no food to offer , but they tried to give him imperial legitimacy ; with the Senate 's acquiescence , he elevated Priscus Attalus as his puppet emperor , and he marched on Ravenna . Honorius was planning to flee to Constantinople when a reinforcing army of 4,000 soldiers from the East disembarked in Ravenna . These garrisoned the walls and Honorius held on . He had Constantine 's principal court supporter executed and Constantine abandoned plans to march to Honorius 's defence . Attalus failed to establish his control over the Diocese of Africa , and no grain arrived in Rome where the famine became even more frightful . Jerome reports cannibalism within the walls . Attalus brought Alaric no real advantage , failing also to come to any useful agreement with Honorius ( who was offered mutilation , humiliation , and exile ) . Indeed , Attalus 's claim was a marker of threat to Honorius , and Alaric dethroned him after a few months . </P> <P> In 410 Alaric took Rome by starvation , sacked it for three days ( there was relatively little destruction , and in some Christian holy places Alaric 's men even refrained from wanton wrecking and rape ) , and invited its remaining barbarian slaves to join him , which many did . The city of Rome was the seat of the richest senatorial noble families and the centre of their cultural patronage ; to pagans it was the sacred origin of the empire , and to Christians the seat of the heir of Saint Peter , Pope Innocent I , the most authoritative bishop of the West . Rome had not fallen to an enemy since the Battle of the Allia over eight centuries before . Refugees spread the news and their stories throughout the Empire , and the meaning of the fall was debated with religious fervour . Both Christians and pagans wrote embittered tracts , blaming paganism or Christianity respectively for the loss of Rome 's supernatural protection , and blaming Stilicho 's earthly failures in either case . Some Christian responses anticipated the imminence of Judgement Day . Augustine in his book `` City of God '' ultimately rejected the pagan and Christian idea that religion should have worldly benefits ; he developed the doctrine that the City of God in heaven , undamaged by mundane disasters , was the true objective of Christians . More practically , Honorius was briefly persuaded to set aside the laws forbidding pagans to be military officers , so that one Generidus could re-establish Roman control in Dalmatia . Generidus did this with unusual effectiveness ; his techniques were remarkable for this period , in that they included training his troops , disciplining them , and giving them appropriate supplies even if he had to use his own money . The penal laws were reinstated no later than 25 August 410 and the overall trend of repression of paganism continued . </P> Inscription honouring Honorius , as florentissimo invictissimoque , the most excellent and invincible , 417 -- 418 , Forum Romanum <P> Procopius mentions a story in which Honorius , on hearing the news that Rome had `` perished '' , was shocked , thinking the news was in reference to his favorite chicken he had named `` Roma '' . On hearing that Rome itself had fallen he breathed a sigh of relief : </P> <P> At that time they say that the Emperor Honorius in Ravenna received the message from one of the eunuchs , evidently a keeper of the poultry , that Roma had perished . And he cried out and said , `` And yet it has just eaten from my hands ! '' For he had a very large cockerel , Roma by name ; and the eunuch comprehending his words said that it was the city of Roma which had perished at the hands of Alaric , and the emperor with a sigh of relief answered quickly : `` But I thought that my fowl Roma had perished . '' So great , they say , was the folly with which this emperor was possessed . </P> -- Procopius , The Vandalic War ( De Bellis III. 2.25 -- 26 ) <H3> The Goths move out of Italy ( edit ) </H3> <P> Alaric then moved south , intending to sail to Africa , but his ships were wrecked in a storm and he shortly died of fever . His successor Ataulf , still regarded as an usurper and given only occasional and short - term grants of supplies , moved north into the turmoil of Gaul , where there was some prospect of food . His supergroup of barbarians are called the Visigoths in modern works : they may now have been developing their own sense of identity . </P> <H2> 405 -- 418 in the Gallic provinces ; barbarians and usurpers , loss of Britannia , partial loss of Hispania and Gaul ( edit ) </H2> <P> The Crossing of the Rhine in 405 / 6 brought unmanageable numbers of German and Alan barbarians ( perhaps some 30,000 warriors , 100,000 people ) into Gaul . They may have been trying to get away from the Huns , who about this time advanced to occupy the Great Hungarian Plain . For the next few years these barbarian tribes wandered in search of food and employment , while Roman forces fought each other in the name of Honorius and a number of competing claimants to the imperial throne . </P> <P> The remaining troops in Britannia elevated a succession of imperial usurpers . The last , Constantine III , raised an army from the remaining troops in Britannia , invaded Gaul and defeated forces loyal to Honorius led by Sarus . Constantine 's power reached its peak in 409 when he controlled Gaul and beyond , he was joint consul with Honorius and his magister militum Gerontius defeated the last Roman force to try to hold the borders of Hispania . It was led by relatives of Honorius ; Constantine executed them . Gerontius went to Hispania where he may have settled the Sueves and the Asding Vandals . Gerontius then fell out with his master and elevated one Maximus as his own puppet emperor . He defeated Constantine and was besieging him in Arelate when Honorius 's general Constantius arrived from Italy with an army ( possibly , mainly of Hun mercenaries ) . Gerontius 's troops deserted him and he committed suicide . Constantius continued the siege , defeating a relieving army . Constantine surrendered in 411 with a promise that his life would be spared , and was executed . </P> <P> In 410 , the Roman civitates of Britannia rebelled against Constantine and evicted his officials . They asked for help from Honorius , who replied that they should look to their own defence . While the British may have regarded themselves as Roman for several generations , and British armies may at times have fought in Gaul , no central Roman government is known to have appointed officials in Britannia thereafter . </P> <P> In 411 , Jovinus rebelled and took over Constantine 's remaining troops on the Rhine . He relied on the support of Burgundians and Alans to whom he offered supplies and land . In 413 Jovinus also recruited Sarus ; Ataulf destroyed their regime in the name of Honorius and both Jovinus and Sarus were executed . The Burgundians were settled on the left bank of the Rhine . Ataulf then operated in the south of Gaul , sometimes with short - term supplies from the Romans . All usurpers had been defeated , but large barbarian groups remained un-subdued in both Gaul and Hispania. . The imperial government was quick to restore the Rhine frontier . The invading tribes of 407 had passed into Spain at the end of 409 but the Visigoths had exited Italy at the beginning of 412 and settled themselves in Narbo . </P> <P> Heraclianus was still in command in the diocese of Africa , the last of the clique that overthrew Stilicho to retain power . In 413 he led an invasion of Italy , lost to a subordinate of Constantius , and fled back to Africa where he was murdered by Constantius 's agents . </P> <P> In January 414 Roman naval forces blockaded Ataulf in Narbo , where he married Galla Placidia . The choir at the wedding included Attalus , a puppet emperor without revenues or soldiers . Ataulf famously declared that he had abandoned his intention to set up a Gothic empire because of the irredeemable barbarity of his followers , and instead he sought to restore the Roman Empire . He handed Attalus over to Honorius 's regime for mutilation , humiliation , and exile , and abandoned Attalus 's supporters . ( One of them , Paulinus Pellaeus , recorded that the Goths considered themselves merciful for allowing him and his household to leave destitute , but alive , without being raped . ) Ataulf moved out of Gaul , to Barcelona . There his infant son by Galla Placidia was buried , and there Ataulf was assassinated by one of his household retainers , possibly a former follower of Sarus . His ultimate successor Wallia had no agreement with the Romans ; his people had to plunder in Hispania for food . </P> <H3> Settlement of 418 ; barbarians within the Empire ( edit ) </H3> Areas allotted to or claimed by barbarian groups in 416 -- 418 <P> In 416 Wallia reached agreement with Constantius ; he sent Galla Placidia back to Honorius and received provisions , six hundred thousand modii of wheat . From 416 to 418 , Wallia 's Goths campaigned in Hispania on Constantius 's behalf , exterminating the Siling Vandals in Baetica and reducing the Alans to the point where the survivors sought the protection of the king of the Asding Vandals . ( After retrenchment they formed another barbarian supergroup , but for the moment they were reduced in numbers and effectively cowed . ) In 418 , by agreement with Constantius , Wallia 's Goths accepted land to farm in Aquitania . Constantius also reinstituted an annual council of the southern Gallic provinces , to meet at Arelate . Although Constantius rebuilt the western field army to some extent -- the Notitia Dignitatum gives a list of the units of the western field army at this time -- he did so only by replacing half of its units ( vanished in the wars since 395 ) by re-graded barbarians , and by garrison troops removed from the frontier . </P> <P> Constantius had married the princess Galla Placidia ( despite her protests ) in 417 . The couple soon had two children , Honoria and Valentinian III , and Constantius was elevated to the position of Augustus in 420 . This earned him the hostility of the Eastern court , which had not agreed to his elevation . Nevertheless , Constantius had achieved an unassailable position at the Western court , in the imperial family , and as the able commander - in - chief of a partially restored army . </P> <P> This settlement represented a real success for the Empire -- a poem by Rutilius Namatianus celebrates his voyage back to Gaul in 417 and his confidence in a restoration of prosperity . But it marked huge losses of territory and of revenue ; Rutilius travelled by ship past the ruined bridges and countryside of Tuscany , and in the west the River Loire had become the effective northern boundary of Roman Gaul . In the east of Gaul the Franks controlled large areas ; the effective line of Roman control until 455 ran from north of Cologne ( lost to the Ripuarian Franks in 459 ) to Boulogne . The Italian areas which had been compelled to support the Goths had most of their taxes remitted for several years . Even in southern Gaul and Hispania large barbarian groups remained , with thousands of warriors , in their own non-Roman military and social systems . Some occasionally acknowledged a degree of Roman political control , but without the local application of Roman leadership and military power they and their individual subgroups pursued their own interests . </P> <H2> 421 -- 433 ; renewed dissension after the death of Constantius , partial loss of the Diocese of Africa ( edit ) </H2> <P> Constantius died in 421 , after only seven months as Augustus . He had been careful to make sure that there was no successor in waiting , and his own children were far too young to take his place . Honorius was unable to control his own court and the death of Constantius initiated more than ten years of instability . Initially Galla Placidia sought Honorius 's favour in the hope that her son might ultimately inherit . Other court interests managed to defeat her , and she fled with her children to the Eastern court in 422 . Honorius himself died , shortly before his thirty - ninth birthday , in 423 . After some months of intrigue , the patrician Castinus installed Joannes as Western Emperor , but the Eastern Roman government proclaimed the child Valentinian III instead , his mother Galla Placidia acting as regent during his minority . Joannes had few troops of his own . He sent Aetius to raise help from the Huns . An Eastern army landed in Italy , captured Joannes , cut his hand off , abused him in public , and killed him with most of his senior officials . Aetius returned , three days after Joannes ' death , at the head of a substantial Hunnic army which made him the most powerful general in Italy . After some fighting , Placidia and Aetius came to an agreement ; the Huns were paid off and sent home , while Aetius received the position of magister militum . </P> <P> Galla Placidia , as Augusta , mother of the Emperor , and his guardian until 437 , could maintain a dominant position in court , but women in Ancient Rome did not exercise military power and she could not herself become a general . She tried for some years to avoid reliance on a single dominant military figure , maintaining a balance of power between her three senior officers , Aetius ( magister militum in Gaul ) , Count Boniface governor in the Diocese of Africa , and Flavius Felix magister militum praesentalis in Italy . Meanwhile , the Empire deteriorated seriously . Apart from the losses in the Diocese of Africa , Hispania was slipping out of central control and into the hands of local rulers and Suevic bandits . In Gaul the Rhine frontier had collapsed , the Visigoths in Aquitaine may have launched further attacks on Narbo and Arelate , and the Franks , increasingly powerful although disunited , were the major power in the north - east . Aremorica was controlled by Bagaudae , local leaders not under the authority of the Empire . Aetius at least campaigned vigorously and mostly victoriously , defeating aggressive Visigoths , Franks , fresh Germanic invaders , Bagaudae in Aremorica , and a rebellion in Noricum . Not for the first time in Rome 's history , a triumvirate of mutually distrustful rulers proved unstable . In 427 Felix tried to recall Boniface from Africa ; he refused , and overcame Felix 's invading force . Boniface probably recruited some Vandal troops among others . </P> <P> In 428 the Vandals and Alans were united under the able , ferocious , and long - lived king Genseric ; he moved his entire people to Tarifa near Gibraltar , divided them into 80 groups nominally of 1,000 people , ( perhaps 20,000 warriors in total ) , and crossed from Hispania to Mauretania without opposition . ( The Straits of Gibraltar were not an important thoroughfare at the time , and there were no significant fortifications nor military presence at this end of the Mediterranean . ) They spent a year moving slowly to Numidia , defeating Boniface . He returned to Italy where Aetius had recently had Felix executed . Boniface was promoted to magister militum and earned the enmity of Aetius , who may have been absent in Gaul at the time . In 432 the two met at the Battle of Ravenna which left Aetius 's forces defeated and Boniface mortally wounded . Aetius temporarily retired to his estates , but after an attempt to murder him he raised another Hunnic army ( probably by conceding parts of Pannonia to them ) and in 433 he returned to Italy , overcoming all rivals . He never threatened to become an Augustus himself and thus maintained the support of the Eastern court , where Valentinian 's cousin Theodosius II reigned until 450 . </P> <H2> 433 -- 454 ; ascendancy of Aetius , loss of carthage ( edit ) </H2> <P> Aetius campaigned vigorously , somewhat stabilizing the situation in Gaul and in Hispania . He relied heavily on his forces of Huns . With a ferocity celebrated centuries later in the Nibelungenlied , the Huns slaughtered many Burgundians on the middle Rhine , re-establishing the survivors as Roman allies , the first Kingdom of the Burgundians . This may have returned some sort of Roman authority to Trier . Eastern troops reinforced Carthage , temporarily halting the Vandals , who in 435 agreed to limit themselves to Numidia and leave the most fertile parts of North Africa in peace . Aetius concentrated his limited military resources to defeat the Visigoths again , and his diplomacy restored a degree of order to Hispania . However , his general Litorius was badly defeated by the Visigoths at Toulouse , and a new Suevic king , Rechiar , began vigorous assaults on what remained of Roman Hispania . At one point Rechiar even allied with Bagaudae . These were Romans not under imperial control ; some of their reasons for rebellion may be indicated by the remarks of a Roman captive under Attila who was happy in his lot , giving a lively account of </P> <P> the vices of a declining empire , of which he had so long been the victim ; the cruel absurdity of the Roman princes , unable to protect their subjects against the public enemy , unwilling to trust them with arms for their own defence ; the intolerable weight of taxes , rendered still more oppressive by the intricate or arbitrary modes of collection ; the obscurity of numerous and contradictory laws ; the tedious and expensive forms of judicial proceedings ; the partial administration of justice ; and the universal corruption , which increased the influence of the rich , and aggravated the misfortunes of the poor . </P> <P> A religious polemic of about this time complains bitterly of the oppression and extortion suffered by all but the richest Romans . Many wished to flee to the Bagaudae or even to foul - smelling barbarians . </P> <P> Although these men differ in customs and language from those with whom they have taken refuge , and are unaccustomed too , if I may say so , to the nauseous odor of the bodies and clothing of the barbarians , yet they prefer the strange life they find there to the injustice rife among the Romans . So you find men passing over everywhere , now to the Goths , now to the Bagaudae , or whatever other barbarians have established their power anywhere ... We call those men rebels and utterly abandoned , whom we ourselves have forced into crime . For by what other causes were they made Bagaudae save by our unjust acts , the wicked decisions of the magistrates , the proscription and extortion of those who have turned the public exactions to the increase of their private fortunes and made the tax indictions their opportunity for plunder ? </P> <P> From Britannia comes an indication of the prosperity which freedom from taxes could bring . </P> <P> No sooner were the ravages of the enemy checked , than the island was deluged with a most extraordinary plenty of all things , greater than was before known , and with it grew up every kind of luxury and licentiousness . </P> <P> Nevertheless , effective imperial protection from barbarian ravages was eagerly sought . About this time authorities in Britannia asked Aetius for help : </P> <P> `` To Aetius , now consul for the third time : the groans of the Britons . '' And again a little further , thus : -- `` The barbarians drive us to the sea ; the sea throws us back on the barbarians : thus two modes of death await us , we are either slain or drowned . '' The Romans , however , could not assist them ... </P> <P> The Visigoths passed another waymark on their journey to full independence ; they made their own foreign policy , sending princesses to make ( rather unsuccessful ) marriage alliances with Rechiar of the Sueves and with Huneric , son of the Vandal king Genseric . </P> <P> In 439 the Vandals moved eastward ( temporarily abandoning Numidia ) and captured Carthage , where they established an independent state with a powerful navy . This brought immediate financial crisis to the Western Empire ; the diocese of Africa was prosperous , normally required few troops to keep it secure , contributed large tax revenues , and exported wheat to feed Rome and many other areas . Roman troops assembled in Sicily , but the planned counter-attack never happened . Huns attacked the Eastern empire , and </P> <P> the troops , which had been sent against Genseric , were hastily recalled from Sicily ; the garrisons , on the side of Persia , were exhausted ; and a military force was collected in Europe , formidable by their arms and numbers , if the generals had understood the science of command , and the soldiers the duty of obedience . The armies of the Eastern empire were vanquished in three successive engagements ... From the Hellespont to Thermopylae , and the suburbs of Constantinople , ( Attila ) ravaged , without resistance , and without mercy , the provinces of Thrace and Macedonia . </P> <P> Attila 's invasions of the East were stopped by the walls of Constantinople , and at this heavily fortified Eastern end of the Mediterranean there were no significant barbarian invasions across the sea into the rich southerly areas of Anatolia , the Levant , and Egypt . Despite internal and external threats , and more religious discord than the West , these provinces remained prosperous contributors to tax revenue ; despite the ravages of Attila 's armies and the extortions of his peace treaties , tax revenue generally continued to be adequate for the essential state functions of the Eastern empire . </P> <P> Genseric settled his Vandals as landowners and in 442 was able to negotiate very favourable peace terms with the Western court . He kept his latest gains and his eldest son Huneric was honoured by betrothal to Princess Eudocia , who carried the legitimacy of the Theodosian dynasty . Huneric 's Gothic wife was suspected of trying to poison her father - in - law Genseric ; he sent her home without her nose or ears , and his Gothic alliance came to an early end . The Romans regained Numidia , and Rome again received a grain supply from Africa . </P> <P> The losses of income from the Diocese of Africa were equivalent to the costs of nearly 40,000 infantry or over 20,000 cavalry . The imperial regime had to increase taxes . Despite admitting that the peasantry could pay no more , and that a sufficient army could not be raised , the imperial regime protected the interests of landowners displaced from Africa and allowed wealthy individuals to avoid taxes . </P> <H3> 444 -- 453 ; attacks by the Empire of Attila the Hun ( edit ) </H3> <P> In 444 , the Huns were united under Attila . His subjects included Huns , outnumbered several times over by other groups , predominantly Germanic . His power rested partly on his continued ability to reward his favoured followers with precious metals , and he continued to attack the Eastern Empire until 450 , by when he had extracted vast sums of money and many other concessions . </P> <P> Attila may not have needed any excuse to turn West , but he received one in the form of a plea for help from Honoria , the Emperor 's sister , who was being forced into a marriage which she resented . Attila claimed Honoria as his wife and half of the Western Empire 's territory as his dowry . Faced with refusal , he invaded Gaul in 451 with a huge army . In the bloody battle of the Catalaunian Plains the invasion was stopped by the combined forces of the barbarians within the Western empire , coordinated by Aetius and supported by what troops he could muster . The next year , Attila invaded Italy and proceeded to march upon Rome , but an outbreak of disease in his army , lack of supplies , reports that Eastern Roman troops were attacking his noncombatant population in Pannonia , and , possibly , Pope Leo 's plea for peace induced him to halt this campaign . Attila unexpectedly died a year later ( 453 ) and his empire crumbled as his followers fought for power . The life of Severinus of Noricum gives glimpses of the general insecurity , and ultimate retreat of the Romans on the Upper Danube , in the aftermath of Attila 's death . The Romans were without adequate forces ; the barbarians inflicted haphazard extortion , murder , kidnap , and plunder on the Romans and on each other . </P> <P> So long as the Roman dominion lasted , soldiers were maintained in many towns at the public expense to guard the boundary wall . When this custom ceased , the squadrons of soldiers and the boundary wall were blotted out together . The troop at Batavis , however , held out . Some soldiers of this troop had gone to Italy to fetch the final pay to their comrades , and no one knew that the barbarians had slain them on the way . </P> <P> In 454 Aetius was personally stabbed to death by Valentinian , who was himself murdered by the dead general 's supporters a year later . </P> <P> ( Valentinian ) thought he had slain his master ; he found that he had slain his protector : and he fell a helpless victim to the first conspiracy which was hatched against his throne . </P> <P> A rich senatorial aristocrat , Petronius Maximus , who had encouraged both murders , then seized the throne . He broke the engagement between Huneric , prince of the Vandals , and Princess Eudocia , and had time to send Avitus to ask for the help of the Visigoths in Gaul before the Vandals sailed to Italy . Petronius was unable to muster any effective response and was killed by a mob as he tried to flee the city . The Vandals entered Rome , and plundered it for two weeks . Despite the shortage of money for the defence of the state , considerable private wealth had accumulated since the previous sack in 410 . The Vandals sailed away with large amounts of treasure and also with the Princess Eudocia , who became the wife of one Vandal king and the mother of another . </P> <P> The Vandals conquered Sicily , and their fleet became a constant danger to Roman sea trade and to the coasts and islands of the western Mediterranean . </P> <H2> 455 -- 456 ; failure of Avitus , further losses in Gaul , rise of Ricimer ( edit ) </H2> <P> Avitus , at the Visigothic court in Burdigala , declared himself Emperor . He moved on Rome with Visigothic support which gained his acceptance by Majorian and Ricimer , commanders of the remaining army of Italy . This was the first time that a barbarian kingdom had played a key role in the imperial succession . Avitus 's son - in - law Sidonius wrote propaganda to present the Visigothic king Theoderic II as a reasonable man with whom a Roman regime could do business . Theoderic 's payoff included precious metal from stripping the remaining public ornaments of Italy , and an unsupervised campaign in Hispania . There he not only defeated the Sueves , executing his brother - in - law Rechiar , but he also plundered Roman cities . The Burgundians expanded their kingdom in the Rhone valley and the Vandals took the remains of the Diocese of Africa . In 456 the Visigothic army was too heavily engaged in Hispania to be an effective threat to Italy , and Ricimer had just destroyed a pirate fleet of sixty Vandal ships ; Majorian and Ricimer marched against Avitus and defeated him near Placentia . He was forced to become Bishop of Placentia , and died ( possibly murdered ) a few weeks later . </P> <H2> 457 -- 467 ; resurgence under Majorian , attempt to recover Africa , control by Ricimer ( edit ) </H2> During his four - year reign Majorian reconquered most of Hispania and southern Gaul , meanwhile reducing the Visigoths , Burgundians and Suevi to federate status . <P> Majorian and Ricimer were now in control of Italy . Ricimer was the son of a Suevic king and his mother was the daughter of a Gothic one , so he could not aspire to an imperial throne . After some months , allowing for negotiation with the new emperor of Constantinople and the defeat of 900 Alamannic invaders of Italy by one of his subordinates , Majorian was acclaimed as Augustus . Majorian is described by Gibbon as `` a great and heroic character '' . He rebuilt the army and navy of Italy with vigour and set about recovering the remaining Gallic provinces , which had not recognized his elevation . He defeated the Visigoths at the Battle of Arelate , reducing them to federate status and obliging them to give up their claims in Hispania ; he moved on to subdue the Burgundians , the Gallo - Romans around Lugdunum ( who were granted tax concessions and whose senior officials were appointed from their own ranks ) and the Suevi and Bagaudae in Hispania . Marcellinus , magister militum in Dalmatia and the pagan general of a well - equipped army , acknowledged him as emperor and recovered Sicily from the Vandals . Aegidius also acknowledged Majorian and took effective charge of northern Gaul . ( Aegidius may also have used the title `` King of the Franks '' . ) Abuses in tax collection were reformed and the city councils were strengthened , both actions necessary to rebuild the strength of the Empire but disadvantageous to the richest aristocrats . Majorian prepared a fleet at Carthago Nova for the essential reconquest of the Diocese of Africa . </P> <P> The fleet was burned by traitors , and Majorian made peace with the Vandals and returned to Italy . Here Ricimer met him , arrested him , and executed him five days later . Marcellinus in Dalmatia , and Aegidius around Soissons in northern Gaul , rejected both Ricimer and his puppets and maintained some version of Roman rule in their areas . Ricimer later ceded Narbo and its hinterland to the Visigoths for their help against Aegidius ; this made it impossible for Roman armies to march from Italy to Hispania . Ricimer was then the effective ruler of Italy ( but little else ) for several years . From 461 to 465 the pious Italian aristocrat Libius Severus reigned . There is no record of anything significant that he even tried to achieve , he was never acknowledged by the East whose help Ricimer needed , and he died conveniently in 465 . </P> <H2> 467 -- 472 , Anthemius ; an emperor and an army from the East ( edit ) </H2> Tremissis of Anthemius <P> After two years without a Western Emperor , the Eastern court nominated Anthemius , a successful general who had a strong claim on the Eastern throne . He arrived in Italy with an army , supported by Marcellinus and his fleet ; he married his daughter to Ricimer , and he was proclaimed Augustus in 467 . In 468 , at vast expense , the Eastern empire assembled an enormous force to help the West retake the Diocese of Africa . Marcellinus rapidly drove the Vandals from Sardinia and Sicily , and a land invasion evicted them from Tripolitania . The commander in chief with the main force defeated a Vandal fleet near Sicily and landed at Cape Bon . Here Genseric offered to surrender , if he could have a five - day truce to prepare the process . He used the respite to prepare a full - scale attack preceded by fireships , which destroyed most of the Roman fleet and killed many of its soldiers . The Vandals were confirmed in their possession of the Diocese of Africa and they retook Sardinia and Sicily . Marcellinus was murdered , possibly on orders from Ricimer . The Praetorian prefect of Gaul , Arvandus , tried to persuade the new king of the Visigoths to rebel , on the grounds that Roman power in Gaul was finished anyway , but he refused . </P> <P> Anthemius was still in command of an army in Italy . Additionally , in northern Gaul , a British army led by one Riothamus , operated in imperial interests . Anthemius sent his son over the Alps , with an army , to request that the Visigoths return southern Gaul to Roman control . This would have allowed the Empire land access to Hispania again . The Visigoths refused , defeated the forces of both Riothamus and Anthemius , and with the Burgundians took over almost all of the remaining imperial territory in southern Gaul . </P> <P> Ricimer then quarreled with Anthemius , and besieged him in Rome , which surrendered in July 472 after more months of starvation . Anthemius was captured and executed ( on Ricimer 's orders ) by the Burgundian prince Gundobad . In August Ricimer died of a pulmonary haemorrhage . Olybrius , his new emperor , named Gundobad as his patrician , then died himself shortly thereafter . </P> <H2> 472 -- 476 ; the final emperors , puppets of the Warlords ( edit ) </H2> <P> After the death of Olybrius there was a further interregnum until March 473 , when Gundobad proclaimed Glycerius emperor . He may have made some attempt to intervene in Gaul ; if so , it was unsuccessful . </P> Tremissis of Julius Nepos <P> In 474 Julius Nepos , nephew and successor of the general Marcellinus , arrived in Rome with soldiers and authority from the eastern emperor Leo I. Gundobad had already left to contest the Burgundian throne in Gaul and Glycerius gave up without a fight , retiring to become bishop of Salona in Dalmatia . </P> <P> In 475 , Orestes , a former secretary of Attila , drove Julius Nepos out of Ravenna and proclaimed his own son Flavius Momyllus Romulus Augustus ( Romulus Augustulus ) to be Emperor , on October 31 . His surname ' Augustus ' was given the diminutive form ' Augustulus ' by rivals because he was still a minor , and he was never recognized outside of Italy as a legitimate ruler . </P> <P> In 476 , Orestes refused to grant Odoacer and the Heruli federated status , prompting an invasion . Orestes fled to the city of Pavia on August 23 , 476 , where the city 's bishop gave him sanctuary . Orestes was soon forced to flee Pavia when Odoacer 's army broke through the city walls , and his army ravaged the city . Odoacer 's army chased Orestes to Piacenza , where they captured and executed him on August 28 , 476 . </P> <P> On September 4 , 476 , Odoacer forced then 16 - year - old Romulus Augustulus , whom his father Orestes had proclaimed to be Rome 's Emperor , to abdicate . After deposing Romulus , Odoacer did not execute him . The Anonymus Valesianus wrote that Odoacer , `` taking pity on his youth '' , spared Romulus ' life and granted him an annual pension of 6,000 solidi before sending him to live with relatives in Campania . Odoacer then installed himself as ruler over Italy , and sent the Imperial insignia to Constantinople . </P> <H2> From 476 ; last emperor , rump states ( edit ) </H2> Europe and the Near East in 476 AD <P> By convention , the Western Roman Empire is deemed to have ended on 4 September 476 , when Odoacer deposed Romulus Augustulus and proclaimed himself ruler of Italy , but this convention is subject to many qualifications . In Roman constitutional theory , the Empire was still simply united under one emperor , implying no abandonment of territorial claims . In areas where the convulsions of the dying Empire had made organized self - defence legitimate , rump states continued under some form of Roman rule after 476 . Julius Nepos still claimed to be Emperor of the West and controlled Dalmatia until his murder in 480 . Syagrius son of Aegidius ruled the Domain of Soissons until his murder in 487 . The indigenous inhabitants of Mauretania developed kingdoms of their own , independent of the Vandals , with strong Roman traits . They again sought Imperial recognition with the reconquests of Justinian I , and they put up effective resistance to the Muslim conquest of the Maghreb . While the civitates of Britannia sank into a level of material development inferior even to their pre-Roman Iron Age ancestors , they maintained identifiably Roman traits for some time , and they continued to look to their own defence as Honorius had authorized . </P> The Ostrogothic Kingdom , which rose from the ruins of the Western Roman Empire <P> Odoacer began to negotiate with the East Roman ( Byzantine ) Emperor Zeno , who was busy dealing with unrest in the East . Zeno eventually granted Odoacer the status of patrician and accepted him as his own viceroy of Italy . Zeno , however , insisted that Odoacer had to pay homage to Julius Nepos as the Emperor of the Western Empire . Odoacer never returned any territory or real power , but he did issue coins in the name of Julius Nepos throughout Italy . The murder of Julius Nepos in 480 ( Glycerius may have been among the conspirators ) prompted Odoacer to invade Dalmatia , annexing it to his Kingdom of Italy . In 488 the Eastern emperor authorized a troublesome Goth , Theoderic ( later known as `` the Great '' ) to take Italy . After several indecisive campaigns , in 493 Theoderic and Odoacer agreed to rule jointly . They celebrated their agreement with a banquet of reconciliation , at which Theoderic 's men murdered Odoacer 's , and Theoderic personally cut Odoacer in half . </P> <H2> Legacy ( edit ) </H2> Main article : Legacy of the Roman Empire <P> The Roman Empire was not only a political unity enforced by violence . It was also the combined and elaborated civilization of the Mediterranean basin and beyond . It included manufacture , trade , and architecture , widespread secular literacy , written law , and an international language of science and literature . The Western barbarians lost much of these higher cultural practices , but their redevelopment in the Middle Ages by polities aware of the Roman achievement formed the basis for the later development of Europe . </P> <P> Observing the cultural and archaeological continuities through and beyond the period of lost political control , the process has been described as a complex cultural transformation , rather than a fall . </P> <H2> See also ( edit ) </H2> <Ul> <Li> Comparative studies of the Roman and Han empires </Li> <Li> Decline of the Byzantine Empire ( Fall of the Eastern Roman Empire ) </Li> <Li> Historiography of the fall of the Roman Empire </Li> <Li> Last of the Romans </Li> <Li> Late Roman army </Li> </Ul> <H2> Notes ( edit ) </H2> <Ol> <Li> Jump up ^ Ward - Perkins 2007 , p. 1 . </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ e.g. Why Nations Fail .

Increasing pressure from barbarians outside Roman culture also <wd_idx<210>> contributed greatly to the collapse . The reasons for the <wd_idx<220>> collapse are major subjects of the historiography of the ancient <wd_idx<230>> world and they inform much modern discourse on state failure <wd_idx<240>> . </P> <P> Relevant dates include 117 CE , when <wd_idx<250>> the Empire was at its greatest territorial extent , and <wd_idx<260>> the accession of Diocletian in 284 .

By 476 when Odoacer deposed the Emperor <wd_idx<330>> Romulus , the Western Roman Emperor wielded negligible military , <wd_idx<340>> political , or financial power and had no effective control <wd_idx<350>> over the scattered Western domains that could still be described <wd_idx<360>> as Roman .

For Cassius Dio , the accession of <wd_idx<1070>> the emperor Commodus in 180 CE marked the descent `` <wd_idx<1080>> from a kingdom of gold to one of rust and <wd_idx<1090>> iron '' . Gibbon started his story in 98 and <wd_idx<1100>> Theodor Mommsen regarded the whole of the imperial period as <wd_idx<1110>> unworthy of inclusion in his Nobel Prize - winning History <wd_idx<1120>> of Rome . Arnold J. Toynbee and James Burke argue <wd_idx<1130>> that the entire Imperial era was one of steady decay <wd_idx<1140>> of institutions founded in republican times .

The emperors , anxious for their personal <wd_idx<1340>> safety and the public peace , were reduced to the <wd_idx<1350>> base expedient of corrupting the discipline which rendered them alike <wd_idx<1360>> formidable to their sovereign and to the enemy ; the <wd_idx<1370>> vigour of the military government was relaxed , and finally <wd_idx<1380>> dissolved , by the partial institutions of Constantine ; and <wd_idx<1390>> the Roman world was overwhelmed by a deluge of Barbarians <wd_idx<1400>> . </P> -- Edward Gibbon .

Historians still try to analyze the reasons for loss <wd_idx<1460>> of political control over a vast territory ( and , <wd_idx<1470>> as a subsidiary theme , the reasons for the survival <wd_idx<1480>> of the Eastern Roman Empire ) . Comparison has also <wd_idx<1490>> been made with China after the end of the Han <wd_idx<1500>> dynasty , which re-established unity under the Sui dynasty while <wd_idx<1510>> the Mediterranean world remained politically disunited . </P> <P> Low <wd_idx<1520>> taxes helped the Roman aristocracy increase their wealth , which <wd_idx<1530>> equalled or exceeded the revenues of the central government . <wd_idx<1540>> An emperor sometimes replenished his treasury by confiscating the estates <wd_idx<1550>> of the `` super-rich '' , but in the", "<wd_idx<1530>> equalled or exceeded the revenues of the central government . <wd_idx<1540>> An emperor sometimes replenished his treasury by confiscating the estates <wd_idx<1550>> of the `` super-rich '' , but in the later <wd_idx<1560>> period , the resistance of the wealthy to paying taxes <wd_idx<1570>> was one of the factors contributing to the collapse of <wd_idx<1580>> the Empire . </P> <H3> Alternative descriptions and labels ( <wd_idx<1590>> edit ) </H3> Main article : Late Antiquity <P> From <wd_idx<1600>> at least the time of Henri Pirenne scholars have described <wd_idx<1610>> a continuity of Roman culture and political legitimacy long after <wd_idx<1620>> 476 . Pirenne postponed the demise of classical civilization to <wd_idx<1630>> the 8th century . He challenged the notion that Germanic <wd_idx<1640>> barbarians had caused the Western Roman Empire to end , <wd_idx<1650>> and he refused to equate the end of the Western <wd_idx<1660>> Roman Empire with the end of the office of emperor <wd_idx<1670>> in Italy .

He pointed out the essential continuity of <wd_idx<1680>> the economy of the Roman Mediterranean even after the barbarian <wd_idx<1690>> invasions , and suggested that only the Muslim conquests represented <wd_idx<1700>> a decisive break with antiquity . The more recent formulation <wd_idx<1710>> of a historical period characterized as `` Late Antiquity '' <wd_idx<1720>> emphasizes the transformations of ancient to medieval worlds within a <wd_idx<1730>> cultural continuity . In recent decades archaeologically - based argument <wd_idx<1740>> even extends the continuity in material culture and in patterns <wd_idx<1750>> of settlement as late as the eleventh century . Observing <wd_idx<1760>> the political reality of lost control , but also the <wd_idx<1770>> cultural and archaeological continuities , the process has been described <wd_idx<1780>> as a complex cultural transformation , rather than a fall <wd_idx<1790>> . </P> <H2> Height of power , crises , and <wd_idx<1800>> recoveries ( edit ) </H2> ", "<wd_idx<1780>> as a complex cultural transformation , rather than a fall <wd_idx<1790>> . </P> <H2> Height of power , crises , and <wd_idx<1800>> recoveries ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Height of power ( <wd_idx<1810>> edit ) </H3> <P> The Roman Empire reached its greatest <wd_idx<1820>> geographical extent under Trajan ( emperor 98 -- 117 ) <wd_idx<1830>> , who ruled a prosperous state that stretched from Armenia <wd_idx<1840>> to the Atlantic . The Empire had large numbers of <wd_idx<1850>> trained , supplied , and disciplined soldiers , as well <wd_idx<1860>> as a comprehensive civil administration based in thriving cities with <wd_idx<1870>> effective control over public finances . Among its literate elite <wd_idx<1880>> it had ideological legitimacy as the only worthwhile form of <wd_idx<1890>> civilization and a cultural unity based on comprehensive familiarity with <wd_idx<1900>> Greek and Roman literature and rhetoric .

The Empire 's <wd_idx<1910>> power allowed it to maintain extreme differences of wealth and <wd_idx<1920>> status ( including slavery on a large scale ) , <wd_idx<1930>> and its wide - ranging trade networks permitted even modest <wd_idx<1940>> households to use goods made by professionals far away . <wd_idx<1950>> </P> <P> Its financial system allowed it to raise significant <wd_idx<1960>> taxes which , despite endemic corruption , supported a large <wd_idx<1970>> regular army with logistics and training . The cursus honorum <wd_idx<1980>> , a standardized series of military and civil posts organised <wd_idx<1990>> for ambitious aristocratic men , ensured that powerful noblemen became <wd_idx<2000>> familiar with military and civil command and administration . At <wd_idx<2010>> a lower level within the army , connecting the aristocrats <wd_idx<2020>> at the top with the private soldiers , a large <wd_idx<2030>> number of centurions were well - rewarded , literate , <wd_idx<2040>> and responsible for training , discipline , administration , and <wd_idx<2050>> leadership in battle .

City governments with their own properties <wd_idx<2060>> and revenues functioned effectively at a local level ; membership <wd_idx<2070>> of city councils involved lucrative opportunities for independent decision - <wd_idx<2080>> making , and , despite its obligations , became seen <wd_idx<2090>> as a privilege . Under a series of emperors who <wd_idx<2100>> each adopted a mature and capable successor , the Empire <wd_idx<2110>> did not require civil wars to regulate the imperial succession <wd_idx<2120>> . Requests could be submitted directly to the better emperors <wd_idx<2130>> , and the answers had the force of law , <wd_idx<2140>> putting the imperial power directly in touch with even humble <wd_idx<2150>> subjects . The cults of polytheist religion were hugely varied <wd_idx<2160>> , but none claimed that theirs was the only truth <wd_idx<2170>> , and their followers displayed mutual tolerance , producing a <wd_idx<2180>> polyphonous religious harmony .

Heavy mortality in 165 -- <wd_idx<2220>> 180 from the Antonine Plague seriously impaired attempts to repel <wd_idx<2230>> Germanic invaders , but the legions generally held or at <wd_idx<2240>> least speedily re-instated the borders of the Empire . </P> <wd_idx<2250>> Map of the Roman Empire in the early second century <wd_idx<2260>> <H3> Crisis of the third century ( edit ) </H3> <wd_idx<2270>> Main article : Crisis of the Third Century <P> The <wd_idx<2280>> Empire suffered from multiple , serious crises during the third <wd_idx<2290>> century , including the rise of the Sassanid Empire , <wd_idx<2300>> which inflicted three crushing defeats on Roman field armies and <wd", "<wd_idx<2280>> Empire suffered from multiple , serious crises during the third <wd_idx<2290>> century , including the rise of the Sassanid Empire , <wd_idx<2300>> which inflicted three crushing defeats on Roman field armies and <wd_idx<2310>> remained a potent threat for centuries . Other disasters included <wd_idx<2320>> repeated civil wars , barbarian invasions , and more mass <wd_idx<2330>> mortality in the Plague of Cyprian ( from 250 onwards <wd_idx<2340>> ) . Rome abandoned the province of Dacia on the <wd_idx<2350>> north of the Danube ( 271 ) , and for <wd_idx<2360>> a short period the Empire split into a Gallic Empire <wd_idx<2370>> in the West ( 260 -- 274 ) , a <wd_idx<2380>> Palmyrene Empire in the East ( 260 -- 273 ) <wd_idx<2390>> , and a central Roman rump state .

The Empire survived the Crisis of the <wd_idx<2430>> Third Century , directing its economy successfully towards defence , <wd_idx<2440>> but survival came at the price of a more centralized <wd_idx<2450>> and bureaucratic state . Under Gallienus the senatorial aristocracy ceased <wd_idx<2460>> joining the ranks of the senior military commanders , its <wd_idx<2470>> typical members lacking interest in military service and showing incompetence <wd_idx<2480>> at command . </P> The divided Empire in 271 CE <wd_idx<2490>> <H3> Reunification and political division ( edit ) </H3> <P> <wd_idx<2500>> Aurelian reunited the empire in 274 ; and from 284 <wd_idx<2510>> Diocletian and his successors reorganized it with more emphasis on <wd_idx<2520>> the military .

With the <wd_idx<2560>> limited communications of the time , both the European and <wd_idx<2570>> the Eastern frontiers needed the attention of their own supreme <wd_idx<2580>> commanders . Diocletian tried to solve this problem by re-establishing <wd_idx<2590>> an adoptive succession with a senior ( Augustus ) and <wd_idx<2600>> junior ( Caesar ) emperor in each half of the <wd_idx<2610>> Empire , but this system of tetrarchy broke down within <wd_idx<2620>> one generation ; the hereditary principle re-established itself with generally <wd_idx<2630>> unfortunate results , and thereafter civil war became again the <wd_idx<2640>> main method of establishing new imperial regimes .

From <wd_idx<2680>> then on , the Empire existed in constant tension between <wd_idx<2690>> the need for two emperors and their mutual mistrust . <wd_idx<2700>> </P> <P> Until late in the fourth century the united <wd_idx<2710>> Empire retained sufficient power to launch attacks against its enemies <wd_idx<2720>> in Germania and in the Sassanid Empire . Receptio of <wd_idx<2730>> barbarians became widely practiced : imperial authorities admitted potentially hostile <wd_idx<2740>> groups into the Empire , split them up , and <wd_idx<2750>> allotted to them lands , status , and duties within <wd_idx<2760>> the imperial system .

Normally the Romans managed the <wd_idx<2800>> process carefully , with sufficient military force on hand to <wd_idx<2810>> ensure compliance , and cultural assimilation followed over the next <wd_idx<2820>> generation or two . </P> Map of the Roman Empire <wd_idx<2830>> under the Tetrarchy , showing the dioceses and the four <wd_idx<2840>> Tetrarchs ' zones of responsibility <H3> Growing social divisions ( <wd_idx<2850>> edit ) </H3> <P> The new supreme rulers disposed of <wd_idx<2860>> the legal fiction of the early Empire ( seeing the <wd_idx<2870>> emperor as but the first among equals ) ; emperors <wd_idx<2880>> from Aurelian ( reigned 270 -- 275 ) onwards openly <wd_idx<2890>> styled themselves as dominus et deus , `` lord and <wd_idx<2900>> god '' , titles appropriate for a master -", "<wd_idx<2880>> from Aurelian ( reigned 270 -- 275 ) onwards openly <wd_idx<2890>> styled themselves as dominus et deus , `` lord and <wd_idx<2900>> god '' , titles appropriate for a master - slave <wd_idx<2910>> relationship . An elaborate court ceremonial developed , and obsequious <wd_idx<2920>> flattery became the order of the day . Under Diocletian <wd_idx<2930>> , the flow of direct requests to the emperor rapidly <wd_idx<2940>> reduced and soon ceased altogether . No other form of <wd_idx<2950>> direct access replaced them , and the emperor received only <wd_idx<2960>> information filtered through his courtiers . </P> <P> Official cruelty <wd_idx<2970>> , supporting extortion and corruption , may also have become <wd_idx<2980>> more commonplace . While the scale , complexity , and <wd_idx<2990>> violence of government were unmatched , the emperors lost control <wd_idx<3000>> over their whole realm insofar as that control came increasingly <wd_idx<3010>> to be wielded by anyone who paid for it . <wd_idx<3020>> Meanwhile , the richest senatorial families , immune from most <wd_id", "<wd_idx<3000>> over their whole realm insofar as that control came increasingly <wd_idx<3010>> to be wielded by anyone who paid for it . <wd_idx<3020>> Meanwhile , the richest senatorial families , immune from most <wd_idx<3030>> taxation , engrossed more and more of the available wealth <wd_idx<3040>> and income , while also becoming divorced from any tradition <wd_idx<3050>> of military excellence . One scholar identifies a great increase <wd_idx<3060>> in the purchasing power of gold , two and a <wd_idx<3070>> half fold from 274 to the later fourth century , <wd_idx<3080>> which may be an index of growing economic inequality between <wd_idx<3090>> a gold - rich elite and a cash - poor <wd_idx<3100>> peasantry . </P> <P> Within the late Roman military , <wd_idx<3110>> many recruits and even officers had barbarian origins , and <wd_idx<3120>> soldiers are recorded as using possibly - barbarian rituals such <wd_idx<3130>> as elevating a claimant on shields .

His successors generally continued this process , <wd_idx<3240>> and Christianity became the religion of any ambitious civil official <wd_idx<3250>> .

This worsened <wd_idx<3280>> the existing difficulty in keeping the city councils up to <wd_idx<3290>> strength , and the services provided by the cities were <wd_idx<3300>> scamped or abandoned . Public building projects became fewer , <wd_idx<3310>> more often repairs than new construction , and now provided <wd_idx<3320>> at state expense rather than by local grandees wishing to <wd_idx<3330>> consolidate long - term local influence . A further financial <wd_idx<3340>> abuse was Constantius 's increased habit of granting to his <wd_idx<3350>> immediate entourage the estates of persons condemned of treason and <wd_idx<3360>> other capital charges ; this reduced future though not immediate <wd_idx<3370>> income , and those close to the emperor gained a <wd_idx<3380>> strong incentive to stimulate his suspicion of plots . </P> <wd_idx<3390>> <P> Constantine settled Franks on the lower left bank of <wd_idx<3400>> the Rhine ; their settlements required a line of", "<wd_idx<3380>> strong incentive to stimulate his suspicion of plots . </P> <wd_idx<3390>> <P> Constantine settled Franks on the lower left bank of <wd_idx<3400>> the Rhine ; their settlements required a line of fortifications <wd_idx<3410>> to keep them in check , indicating that Rome had <wd_idx<3420>> lost almost all local control . Under Constantius , bandits <wd_idx<3430>> came to dominate areas such as Isauria well within the <wd_idx<3440>> empire . The tribes of Germany also became more populous <wd_idx<3450>> and more threatening . In Gaul , which did not <wd_idx<3460>> really recover from the invasions of the third century , <wd_idx<3470>> there was widespread insecurity and economic decline in the 300s <wd_idx<3480>> , perhaps worst in Armorica . By 350 , after <wd_idx<3490>> decades of pirate attacks , virtually all villas in Armorica <wd_idx<3500>> were deserted , and local use of money ceased about <wd_idx<3510>> 360 .

Repeated attempts to economize on military expenditure included <wd_idx<3520>> billeting troops in cities , where they could less easily <wd_idx<3530>> be kept under military discipline and could more easily extort <wd_idx<3540>> from civilians . Except in the rare case of a <wd_idx<3550>> determined and incorruptible general , these troops proved ineffective in <wd_idx<3560>> action and dangerous to civilians . Frontier troops were often <wd_idx<3570>> given land rather than pay ; as they farmed for <wd_idx<3580>> themselves , their direct costs diminished , but so did <wd_idx<3590>> their effectiveness , and there was much less economic stimulus <wd_idx<3600>> to the frontier economy . However , except for the <wd_idx<3610>> provinces along the lower Rhine , the agricultural economy was <wd_idx<3620>> generally doing well . The average nutritional state of the <wd_idx<3630>> population in the West suffered a serious decline in the <wd_idx<3640>> late second century ; the population of North - Western <wd_idx<3650>> Europe did not recover , though the Mediterranean regions did <wd_id", "<wd_idx<3630>> population in the West suffered a serious decline in the <wd_idx<3640>> late second century ; the population of North - Western <wd_idx<3650>> Europe did not recover , though the Mediterranean regions did <wd_idx<3660>> . </P> <P> The numbers and effectiveness of the regular <wd_idx<3670>> soldiers may have declined during the fourth century : payrolls <wd_idx<3680>> were inflated so that pay could be diverted and exemptions <wd_idx<3690>> from duty sold , their opportunities for personal extortion were <wd_idx<3700>> multiplied by residence in cities , and their effectiveness was <wd_idx<3710>> reduced by concentration on extortion instead of drill . However <wd_idx<3720>> , extortion , gross corruption , and occasional ineffectiveness were <wd_idx<3730>> not new to the Roman army ; there is no <wd_idx<3740>> consensus whether its effectiveness significantly declined before 376 .

The wealth of the church <wd_idx<4320>> increased dramatically , immense resources both public and private being <wd_idx<4330>> used for ecclesiastical construction and support of the religious life <wd_idx<4340>> . Bishops in wealthy cities were thus able to offer <wd_idx<4350>> vast patronage ; Ammianus described some as `` enriched from <wd_idx<4360>> the offerings of matrons , ride seated in carriages , <wd_idx<4370>> wearing clothing chosen with care , and serve banquets so <wd_idx<4380>> lavish that their entertainments outdo the tables of kings '' <wd_idx<4390>> .

Theodosius was unable to recruit enough Roman troops <wd_idx<4890>> , relying on barbarian warbands without Roman military discipline or <wd_idx<4900>> loyalty . In contrast , during the Cimbrian War , <wd_idx<4910>> the Roman Republic , controlling a smaller area than the <wd_idx<4920>> western Empire , had been able to reconstitute large regular <wd_idx<4930>> armies of citizens after greater defeats than Adrianople , and <wd_idx<4940>> it ended that war with the near - extermination of <wd_idx<4950>> the invading barbarian supergroups , each recorded as having more <wd_idx<4960>> than 100,000 warriors ( with allowances for the usual exaggeration <wd_idx<4970>> of numbers by ancient authors ) .

Instead they were either recruited into <wd_idx<5270>> the imperial forces , or settled in the devastated provinces <wd_idx<5280>> along the south bank of the Danube , where the <wd_idx<5290>> regular garrisons were never fully re-established . In some later <wd_idx<5300>> accounts , and widely in recent work , this is <wd_idx<5310>> regarded as a treaty settlement , the first time that <wd_idx<5320>> barbarians were given a home within the Empire in which <wd_idx<5330>> they retained their political and military cohesion .

To compensate <wd_idx<5620>> the Western court for the loss of Gaul , Hispania <wd_idx<5630>> , and Britannia , Theodosius ceded the diocese of Dacia <wd_idx<5640>> and the diocese of Macedonia to their control . In <wd_idx<5650>> 387 Maximus invaded Italy , forcing Valentinian II to flee <wd_idx<5660>> to the East , where he accepted Nicene Christianity . <wd_idx<5670>> Maximus boasted to Ambrose of the numbers of barbarians in <wd_idx<5680>> his forces , and hordes of Goths , Huns , <wd_idx<5690>> and Alans followed Theodosius .

He <wd_idx<5790>> also appointed Arbogast , a pagan general of Frankish origin <wd_idx<5800>> , as Valentinian 's commander - in - chief and <wd_idx<5810>> guardian .

In the immediate aftermath of <wd_idx<5990>> Theodosius 's death , the magister militum Stilicho , married <wd_idx<6000>> to Theodosius 's niece , asserted himself in the West <wd_idx<6010>> as the guardian of Honorius and commander of the remains <wd_idx<6020>> of the defeated Western army .

This <wd_idx<10610>> earned him the hostility of the Eastern court , which <wd_idx<10620>> had not agreed to his elevation . Nevertheless , Constantius <wd_idx<10630>> had achieved an unassailable position at the Western court , <wd_idx<10640>> in the imperial family , and as the able commander <wd_idx<10650>> - in - chief of a partially restored army . <wd_idx<10660>> </P> <P> This settlement represented a real success for the <wd_idx<10670>> Empire -- a poem by Rutilius Namat", "<wd_idx<10650>> - in - chief of a partially restored army . <wd_idx<10660>> </P> <P> This settlement represented a real success for the <wd_idx<10670>> Empire -- a poem by Rutilius Namatianus celebrates his voyage <wd_idx<10680>> back to Gaul in 417 and his confidence in a <wd_idx<10690>> restoration of prosperity .

Honorius was unable to control his <wd_idx<10920>> own court and the death of Constantius initiated more than <wd_idx<10930>> ten years of instability . Initially Galla Placidia sought Honorius <wd_idx<10940>> 's favour in the hope that her son might ultimately <wd_idx<10950>> inherit . Other court interests managed to defeat her , <wd_idx<10960>> and she fled with her children to the Eastern court <wd_idx<10970>> in 422 . Honorius himself died , shortly before his <wd_idx<10980>> thirty - ninth birthday , in 423 . After some <wd_idx<10990>> months of intrigue , the patrician Castinus installed Joannes as <wd_idx<11000>> Western Emperor , but the Eastern Roman government proclaimed the <wd_idx<11010>> child Valentinian III instead , his mother Galla Placidia acting <wd_idx<11020>> as regent during his minority . Joannes had few troops <wd_idx<11030>> of his own . He sent A", "<wd_idx<11010>> child Valentinian III instead , his mother Galla Placidia acting <wd_idx<11020>> as regent during his minority . Joannes had few troops <wd_idx<11030>> of his own . He sent Aetius to raise help <wd_idx<11040>> from the Huns . An Eastern army landed in Italy <wd_idx<11050>> , captured Joannes , cut his hand off , abused <wd_idx<11060>> him in public , and killed him with most of <wd_idx<11070>> his senior officials . Aetius returned , three days after <wd_idx<11080>> Joannes ' death , at the head of a substantial <wd_idx<11090>> Hunnic army which made him the most powerful general in <wd_idx<11100>> Italy . After some fighting , Placidia and Aetius came <wd_idx<11110>> to an agreement ; the Huns were paid off and <wd_idx<11120>> sent home , while Aetius received the position of magister <wd_idx<11130>> militum . </P> <P> Galla Placidia , as Augusta , <wd_idx<11140>> mother of the Emperor , and his guardian until 437 <wd_idx<11150>> , could maintain a dominant", "<wd_idx<11130>> militum . </P> <P> Galla Placidia , as Augusta , <wd_idx<11140>> mother of the Emperor , and his guardian until 437 <wd_idx<11150>> , could maintain a dominant position in court , but <wd_idx<11160>> women in Ancient Rome did not exercise military power and <wd_idx<11170>> she could not herself become a general . She tried <wd_idx<11180>> for some years to avoid reliance on a single dominant <wd_idx<11190>> military figure , maintaining a balance of power between her <wd_idx<11200>> three senior officers , Aetius ( magister militum in Gaul <wd_idx<11210>> ) , Count Boniface governor in the Diocese of Africa <wd_idx<11220>> , and Flavius Felix magister militum praesentalis in Italy . <wd_idx<11230>> Meanwhile , the Empire deteriorated seriously . Apart from the <wd_idx<11240>> losses in the Diocese of Africa , Hispania was slipping <wd_idx<11250>> out of central control and into the hands of local <wd_idx<11260>> rulers and Suevic bandits .

In Gaul the Rhine frontier <wd_idx<11270>> had collapsed , the Visigoths in Aquitaine may have launched <wd_idx<11280>> further attacks on Narbo and Arelate , and the Franks <wd_idx<11290>> , increasingly powerful although disunited , were the major power <wd_idx<11300>> in the north - east . Aremorica was controlled by <wd_idx<11310>> Bagaudae , local leaders not under the authority of the <wd_idx<11320>> Empire . Aetius at least campaigned vigorously and mostly victoriously <wd_idx<11330>> , defeating aggressive Visigoths , Franks , fresh Germanic invaders <wd_idx<11340>> , Bagaudae in Aremorica , and a rebellion in Noricum <wd_idx<11350>> . Not for the first time in Rome 's history <wd_idx<11360>> , a triumvirate of mutually distrustful rulers proved unstable . <wd_idx<11370>> In 427 Felix tried to recall Boniface from Africa ; <wd_idx<11380>> he refused , and overcame Felix 's invading force . <wd_idx<11390>> Boniface probably recruited some Vandal troops among others", "<wd_idx<11370>> In 427 Felix tried to recall Boniface from Africa ; <wd_idx<11380>> he refused , and overcame Felix 's invading force . <wd_idx<11390>> Boniface probably recruited some Vandal troops among others . </P> <wd_idx<11400>> <P> In 428 the Vandals and Alans were united under <wd_idx<11410>> the able , ferocious , and long - lived king <wd_idx<11420>> Genseric ; he moved his entire people to Tarifa near <wd_idx<11430>> Gibraltar , divided them into 80 groups nominally of 1,000 <wd_idx<11440>> people , ( perhaps 20,000 warriors in total ) , <wd_idx<11450>> and crossed from Hispania to Mauretania without opposition .

In 432 <wd_idx<11540>> the two met at the Battle of Ravenna which left <wd_idx<11550>> Aetius 's forces defeated and Boniface mortally wounded .

With <wd_idx<11670>> a ferocity celebrated centuries later in the Nibelungenlied , the <wd_idx<11680>> Huns slaughtered many Burgundians on the middle Rhine , re-establishing <wd_idx<11690>> the survivors as Roman allies , the first Kingdom of <wd_idx<11700>> the Burgundians . This may have returned some sort of <wd_idx<11710>> Roman authority to Trier .

Aetius concentrated his limited <wd_idx<11750>> military resources to defeat the Visigoths again , and his <wd_idx<11760>> diplomacy restored a degree of order to Hispania . However <wd_idx<11770>> , his general Litorius was badly defeated by the Visigoths <wd_idx<11780>> at Toulouse , and a new Suevic king , Rechiar <wd_idx<11790>> , began vigorous assaults on what remained of Roman Hispania <wd_idx<11800>> . At one point Rechiar even allied with Bagaudae . <wd_idx<11810>> These were Romans not under imperial control ; some of <wd_idx<11820>> their reasons for rebellion may be indicated by the remarks <wd_idx<11830>> of a Roman captive under Attila who was happy in <wd_idx<11840>> his lot , giving a lively account of </P> <P> <wd_idx<11850>> the vices of a declining empire , of which he <wd_idx<11860>> had so long been the victim ; the cruel", "<wd_idx<11840>> his lot , giving a lively account of </P> <P> <wd_idx<11850>> the vices of a declining empire , of which he <wd_idx<11860>> had so long been the victim ; the cruel absurdity <wd_idx<11870>> of the Roman princes , unable to protect their subjects <wd_idx<11880>> against the public enemy , unwilling to trust them with <wd_idx<11890>> arms for their own defence ; the intolerable weight of <wd_idx<11900>> taxes , rendered still more oppressive by the intricate or <wd_idx<11910>> arbitrary modes of collection ; the obscurity of numerous and <wd_idx<11920>> contradictory laws ; the tedious and expensive forms of judicial <wd_idx<11930>> proceedings ; the partial administration of justice ; and the <wd_idx<11940>> universal corruption , which increased the influence of the rich <wd_idx<11950>> , and aggravated the misfortunes of the poor . </P> <wd_idx<11960>> <P> A religious polemic of about this time complains bitterly <wd_idx<11970>> of the oppression and extortion suffered by all but the <wd_idx<11980>> richest Romans .

Attila <wd_idx<12970>> claimed Honoria as his wife and half of the Western <wd_idx<12980>> Empire 's territory as his dowry . Faced with refusal <wd_idx<12990>> , he invaded Gaul in 451 with a huge army <wd_idx<13000>> . In the bloody battle of the Catalaunian Plains the <wd_idx<13010>> invasion was stopped by the combined forces of the barbarians <wd_idx<13020>> within the Western empire , coordinated by Aetius and supported <wd_idx<13030>> by what troops he could muster . The next year <wd_idx<13040>> , Attila invaded Italy and proceeded to march upon Rome <wd_idx<13050>> , but an outbreak of disease in his army , <wd_idx<13060>> lack of supplies , reports that Eastern Roman troops were <wd_idx<13070>> attacking his noncombatant population in Pannonia , and , possibly", "<wd_idx<13050>> , but an outbreak of disease in his army , <wd_idx<13060>> lack of supplies , reports that Eastern Roman troops were <wd_idx<13070>> attacking his noncombatant population in Pannonia , and , possibly <wd_idx<13080>> , Pope Leo 's plea for peace induced him to <wd_idx<13090>> halt this campaign . Attila unexpectedly died a year later <wd_idx<13100>> ( 453 ) and his empire crumbled as his followers <wd_idx<13110>> fought for power . The life of Severinus of Noricum <wd_idx<13120>> gives glimpses of the general insecurity , and ultimate retreat <wd_idx<13130>> of the Romans on the Upper Danube , in the <wd_idx<13140>> aftermath of Attila 's death . The Romans were without <wd_idx<13150>> adequate forces ; the barbarians inflicted haphazard extortion , murder <wd_idx<13160>> , kidnap , and plunder on the Romans and on <wd_idx<13170>> each other . </P> <P> So long as the Roman <wd_idx<13180>> dominion lasted , soldiers were maintained in many towns at <wd_idx<13190>> the public expense to guard the boundary wall .

Petronius was unable to muster any <wd_idx<13390>> effective response and was killed by a mob as he <wd_idx<13400>> tried to flee the city .

Ricimer was the son of a Suevic king and <wd_idx<13810>> his mother was the daughter of a Gothic one , <wd_idx<13820>> so he could not aspire to an imperial throne . <wd_idx<13830>> After some months , allowing for negotiation with the new <wd_idx<13840>> emperor of Constantinople and the defeat of 900 Alamannic invaders <wd_idx<13850>> of Italy by one of his subordinates , Majorian was <wd_idx<13860>> acclaimed as Augustus . Majorian is described by Gibbon as <wd_idx<13870>> `` a great and heroic character '' . He rebuilt <wd_idx<13880>> the army and navy of Italy with vigour and set <wd_idx<13890>> about recovering the remaining Gallic provinces , which had not <wd_idx<13900>> recognized his elevation .

Marcellinus <wd_idx<13970>> , magister militum in Dalmatia and the pagan general of <wd_idx<13980>> a well - equipped army , acknowledged him as emperor <wd_idx<13990>> and recovered Sicily from the Vandals . Aegidius also acknowledged <wd_idx<14000>> Majorian and took effective charge of northern Gaul . ( <wd_idx<14010>> Aegidius may also have used the title `` King of <wd_idx<14020>> the Franks '' . ) Abuses in tax collection were <wd_idx<14030>> reformed and the city councils were strengthened , both actions ", "<wd_idx<14010>> Aegidius may also have used the title `` King of <wd_idx<14020>> the Franks '' . ) Abuses in tax collection were <wd_idx<14030>> reformed and the city councils were strengthened , both actions <wd_idx<14040>> necessary to rebuild the strength of the Empire but disadvantageous <wd_idx<14050>> to the richest aristocrats . Majorian prepared a fleet at <wd_idx<14060>> Carthago Nova for the essential reconquest of the Diocese of <wd_idx<14070>> Africa . </P> <P> The fleet was burned by traitors <wd_idx<14080>> , and Majorian made peace with the Vandals and returned <wd_idx<14090>> to Italy . Here Ricimer met him , arrested him <wd_idx<14100>> , and executed him five days later . Marcellinus in <wd_idx<14110>> Dalmatia , and Aegidius around Soissons in northern Gaul , <wd_idx<14120>> rejected both Ricimer and his puppets and maintained some version <wd_idx<14130>> of Roman rule in their areas .

Ricimer was then <wd_idx<14170>> the effective ruler of Italy ( but little else ) <wd_idx<14180>> for several years . From 461 to 465 the pious <wd_idx<14190>> Italian aristocrat Libius Severus reigned . There is no record <wd_idx<14200>> of anything significant that he even tried to achieve , <wd_idx<14210>> he was never acknowledged by the East whose help Ricimer <wd_idx<14220>> needed , and he died conveniently in 465 . </P> <wd_idx<14230>> <H2> 467 -- 472 , Anthemius ; an emperor and <wd_idx<14240>> an army from the East ( edit ) </H2> Tremissis <wd_idx<14250>> of Anthemius <P> After two years without a Western Emperor <wd_idx<14260>> , the Eastern court nominated Anthemius , a successful general <wd_idx<14270>> who had a strong claim on the Eastern throne .", "<wd_idx<14250>> of Anthemius <P> After two years without a Western Emperor <wd_idx<14260>> , the Eastern court nominated Anthemius , a successful general <wd_idx<14270>> who had a strong claim on the Eastern throne . <wd_idx<14280>> He arrived in Italy with an army , supported by <wd_idx<14290>> Marcellinus and his fleet ; he married his daughter to <wd_idx<14300>> Ricimer , and he was proclaimed Augustus in 467 . <wd_idx<14310>> In 468 , at vast expense , the Eastern empire <wd_idx<14320>> assembled an enormous force to help the West retake the <wd_idx<14330>> Diocese of Africa . Marcellinus rapidly drove the Vandals from <wd_idx<14340>> Sardinia and Sicily , and a land invasion evicted them <wd_idx<14350>> from Tripolitania . The commander in chief with the main <wd_idx<14360>> force defeated a Vandal fleet near Sicily and landed at <wd_idx<14370>> Cape Bon .

This would have allowed the Empire land <wd_idx<14550>> access to Hispania again .

'' The Fall is not the only unifying concept for these events ; the period described as Late Antiquity emphasizes the cultural continuities throughout and beyond the political collapse . </P> <H3> Timespan ( edit ) </H3> <P> The Fall of the Western Roman Empire was the process of decline in the Western Roman Empire in which it failed to enforce its rule . The loss of centralized political control over the West , and the lessened power of the East , are universally agreed , but the theme of decline has been taken to cover a much wider time span than the hundred years from 376 . For Cassius Dio , the accession of the emperor Commodus in 180 CE marked the descent `` from a kingdom of gold to one of rust and iron '' . Gibbon started his story in 98 and Theodor Mommsen regarded the whole of the imperial period as unworthy of inclusion in his Nobel Prize - winning History of Rome . Arnold J. Toynbee and James Burke argue that the entire Imperial era was one of steady decay of institutions founded in republican times . As one convenient marker for the end , 476 has been used since Gibbon , but other markers include the Crisis of the Third Century , the Crossing of the Rhine in 406 ( or 405 ) , the sack of Rome in 410 , the death of Julius Nepos in 480 , all the way to the Fall of New Rome in 1453 . </P> <H3> Reasons ( edit ) </H3> <P> Gibbon gave a classic formulation of reasons why the Fall happened . He began an ongoing controversy about the role of Christianity , but he gave great weight to other causes of internal decline and to attacks from outside the Empire . </P> <P> The story of its ruin is simple and obvious ; and , instead of inquiring why the Roman empire was destroyed , we should rather be surprised that it had subsisted so long . The victorious legions , who , in distant wars , acquired the vices of strangers and mercenaries , first oppressed the freedom of the republic , and afterwards violated the majesty of the purple . The emperors , anxious for their personal safety and the public peace , were reduced to the base expedient of corrupting the discipline which rendered them alike formidable to their sovereign and to the enemy ; the vigour of the military government was relaxed , and finally dissolved , by the partial institutions of Constantine ; and the Roman world was overwhelmed by a deluge of Barbarians . </P> -- Edward Gibbon . The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire , `` General Observations on the Fall of the Roman Empire in the West '' , Chapter 38 <P> Alexander Demandt enumerated 210 different theories on why Rome fell , and new ideas have emerged since .

Comparison has also been made with China after the end of the Han dynasty , which re-established unity under the Sui dynasty while the Mediterranean world remained politically disunited . </P> <P> Low taxes helped the Roman aristocracy increase their wealth , which equalled or exceeded the revenues of the central government . An emperor sometimes replenished his treasury by confiscating the estates of the `` super-rich '' , but in the later period , the resistance of the wealthy to paying taxes was one of the factors contributing to the collapse of the Empire . </P> <H3> Alternative descriptions and labels ( edit ) </H3> Main article : Late Antiquity <P> From at least the time of Henri Pirenne scholars have described a continuity of Roman culture and political legitimacy long after 476 . Pirenne postponed the demise of classical civilization to the 8th century . He challenged the notion that Germanic barbarians had caused the Western Roman Empire to end , and he refused to equate the end of the Western Roman Empire with the end of the office of emperor in Italy . He pointed out the essential continuity of the economy of the Roman Mediterranean even after the barbarian invasions , and suggested that only the Muslim conquests represented a decisive break with antiquity . The more recent formulation of a historical period characterized as `` Late Antiquity '' emphasizes the transformations of ancient to medieval worlds within a cultural continuity . In recent decades archaeologically - based argument even extends the continuity in material culture and in patterns of settlement as late as the eleventh century . Observing the political reality of lost control , but also the cultural and archaeological continuities , the process has been described as a complex cultural transformation , rather than a fall . </P> <H2> Height of power , crises , and recoveries ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Height of power ( edit ) </H3> <P> The Roman Empire reached its greatest geographical extent under Trajan ( emperor 98 -- 117 ) , who ruled a prosperous state that stretched from Armenia to the Atlantic . The Empire had large numbers of trained , supplied , and disciplined soldiers , as well as a comprehensive civil administration based in thriving cities with effective control over public finances . Among its literate elite it had ideological legitimacy as the only worthwhile form of civilization and a cultural unity based on comprehensive familiarity with Greek and Roman literature and rhetoric . The Empire 's power allowed it to maintain extreme differences of wealth and status ( including slavery on a large scale ) , and its wide - ranging trade networks permitted even modest households to use goods made by professionals far away . </P> <P> Its financial system allowed it to raise significant taxes which , despite endemic corruption , supported a large regular army with logistics and training . The cursus honorum , a standardized series of military and civil posts organised for ambitious aristocratic men , ensured that powerful noblemen became familiar with military and civil command and administration . At a lower level within the army , connecting the aristocrats at the top with the private soldiers , a large number of centurions were well - rewarded , literate , and responsible for training , discipline , administration , and leadership in battle . City governments with their own properties and revenues functioned effectively at a local level ; membership of city councils involved lucrative opportunities for independent decision - making , and , despite its obligations , became seen as a privilege . Under a series of emperors who each adopted a mature and capable successor , the Empire did not require civil wars to regulate the imperial succession . Requests could be submitted directly to the better emperors , and the answers had the force of law , putting the imperial power directly in touch with even humble subjects . The cults of polytheist religion were hugely varied , but none claimed that theirs was the only truth , and their followers displayed mutual tolerance , producing a polyphonous religious harmony . Religious strife was rare after the suppression of the Bar Kokhba revolt in 136 ( after which the devastated Judaea ceased to be a major centre for Jewish unrest ) . Heavy mortality in 165 -- 180 from the Antonine Plague seriously impaired attempts to repel Germanic invaders , but the legions generally held or at least speedily re-instated the borders of the Empire . </P> Map of the Roman Empire in the early second century <H3> Crisis of the third century ( edit ) </H3> Main article : Crisis of the Third Century <P> The Empire suffered from multiple , serious crises during the third century , including the rise of the Sassanid Empire , which inflicted three crushing defeats on Roman field armies and remained a potent threat for centuries . Other disasters included repeated civil wars , barbarian invasions , and more mass mortality in the Plague of Cyprian ( from 250 onwards ) . Rome abandoned the province of Dacia on the north of the Danube ( 271 ) , and for a short period the Empire split into a Gallic Empire in the West ( 260 -- 274 ) , a Palmyrene Empire in the East ( 260 -- 273 ) , and a central Roman rump state . The Rhine / Danube frontier also came under more effective threat from larger barbarian groupings , which had developed better agriculture and larger populations . The Empire survived the Crisis of the Third Century , directing its economy successfully towards defence , but survival came at the price of a more centralized and bureaucratic state . Under Gallienus the senatorial aristocracy ceased joining the ranks of the senior military commanders , its typical members lacking interest in military service and showing incompetence at command . </P> The divided Empire in 271 CE <H3> Reunification and political division ( edit ) </H3> <P> Aurelian reunited the empire in 274 ; and from 284 Diocletian and his successors reorganized it with more emphasis on the military . John the Lydian , writing over two centuries later , reported that Diocletian 's army at one point totaled 389,704 men , plus 45,562 in the fleets , and numbers may have increased later . With the limited communications of the time , both the European and the Eastern frontiers needed the attention of their own supreme commanders . Diocletian tried to solve this problem by re-establishing an adoptive succession with a senior ( Augustus ) and junior ( Caesar ) emperor in each half of the Empire , but this system of tetrarchy broke down within one generation ; the hereditary principle re-established itself with generally unfortunate results , and thereafter civil war became again the main method of establishing new imperial regimes . Although Constantine the Great ( in office 306 to 337 ) again re-united the Empire , towards the end of the fourth century the need for division was generally accepted . From then on , the Empire existed in constant tension between the need for two emperors and their mutual mistrust . </P> <P> Until late in the fourth century the united Empire retained sufficient power to launch attacks against its enemies in Germania and in the Sassanid Empire . Receptio of barbarians became widely practiced : imperial authorities admitted potentially hostile groups into the Empire , split them up , and allotted to them lands , status , and duties within the imperial system . In this way many groups provided unfree workers ( coloni ) for Roman landowners , and recruits ( laeti ) for the Roman army . Sometimes their leaders became officers . Normally the Romans managed the process carefully , with sufficient military force on hand to ensure compliance , and cultural assimilation followed over the next generation or two . </P> Map of the Roman Empire under the Tetrarchy , showing the dioceses and the four Tetrarchs ' zones of responsibility <H3> Growing social divisions ( edit ) </H3> <P> The new supreme rulers disposed of the legal fiction of the early Empire ( seeing the emperor as but the first among equals ) ; emperors from Aurelian ( reigned 270 -- 275 ) onwards openly styled themselves as dominus et deus , `` lord and god '' , titles appropriate for a master - slave relationship . An elaborate court ceremonial developed , and obsequious flattery became the order of the day . Under Diocletian , the flow of direct requests to the emperor rapidly reduced and soon ceased altogether . No other form of direct access replaced them , and the emperor received only information filtered through his courtiers . </P> <P> Official cruelty , supporting extortion and corruption , may also have become more commonplace . While the scale , complexity , and violence of government were unmatched , the emperors lost control over their whole realm insofar as that control came increasingly to be wielded by anyone who paid for it . Meanwhile , the richest senatorial families , immune from most taxation , engrossed more and more of the available wealth and income , while also becoming divorced from any tradition of military excellence . One scholar identifies a great increase in the purchasing power of gold , two and a half fold from 274 to the later fourth century , which may be an index of growing economic inequality between a gold - rich elite and a cash - poor peasantry . </P> <P> Within the late Roman military , many recruits and even officers had barbarian origins , and soldiers are recorded as using possibly - barbarian rituals such as elevating a claimant on shields . Some scholars have seen this as an indication of weakness ; others disagree , seeing neither barbarian recruits nor new rituals as causing any problem with the effectiveness or loyalty of the army . </P> <H2> 313 -- 376 : abuse of power , frontier warfare , and rise of Christianity ( edit ) </H2> Further information : History of late ancient Christianity <P> In 313 Constantine I declared official toleration of Christianity , followed over the ensuing decades by establishment of Christian orthodoxy and by official and private action against pagans and non-orthodox Christians . His successors generally continued this process , and Christianity became the religion of any ambitious civil official . Under Constantine the cities lost their revenue from local taxes , and under Constantius II ( r . 337 -- 361 ) their endowments of property . This worsened the existing difficulty in keeping the city councils up to strength , and the services provided by the cities were scamped or abandoned . Public building projects became fewer , more often repairs than new construction , and now provided at state expense rather than by local grandees wishing to consolidate long - term local influence . A further financial abuse was Constantius 's increased habit of granting to his immediate entourage the estates of persons condemned of treason and other capital charges ; this reduced future though not immediate income , and those close to the emperor gained a strong incentive to stimulate his suspicion of plots . </P> <P> Constantine settled Franks on the lower left bank of the Rhine ; their settlements required a line of fortifications to keep them in check , indicating that Rome had lost almost all local control . Under Constantius , bandits came to dominate areas such as Isauria well within the empire . The tribes of Germany also became more populous and more threatening . In Gaul , which did not really recover from the invasions of the third century , there was widespread insecurity and economic decline in the 300s , perhaps worst in Armorica . By 350 , after decades of pirate attacks , virtually all villas in Armorica were deserted , and local use of money ceased about 360 . Repeated attempts to economize on military expenditure included billeting troops in cities , where they could less easily be kept under military discipline and could more easily extort from civilians . Except in the rare case of a determined and incorruptible general , these troops proved ineffective in action and dangerous to civilians . Frontier troops were often given land rather than pay ; as they farmed for themselves , their direct costs diminished , but so did their effectiveness , and there was much less economic stimulus to the frontier economy . However , except for the provinces along the lower Rhine , the agricultural economy was generally doing well . The average nutritional state of the population in the West suffered a serious decline in the late second century ; the population of North - Western Europe did not recover , though the Mediterranean regions did . </P> <P> The numbers and effectiveness of the regular soldiers may have declined during the fourth century : payrolls were inflated so that pay could be diverted and exemptions from duty sold , their opportunities for personal extortion were multiplied by residence in cities , and their effectiveness was reduced by concentration on extortion instead of drill . However , extortion , gross corruption , and occasional ineffectiveness were not new to the Roman army ; there is no consensus whether its effectiveness significantly declined before 376 . Ammianus Marcellinus , himself a professional soldier , repeats longstanding observations about the superiority of contemporary Roman armies being due to training and discipline , not to physical size or strength . Despite a possible decrease in its ability to assemble and supply large armies , Rome maintained an aggressive and potent stance against perceived threats almost to the end of the fourth century . </P> Solidus of Julian , c. 361 . Obverse : Julian with the beard appropriate to a Neoplatonic philosopher . Inscription : FL ( AVIVS ) CL ( AVDIVS ) IVLIANVS PP ( = Pater Patriae , `` father of the nation '' ) AVG ( = Augustus ) . Reverse : an armed Roman , military standard in one hand , a captive in the other . Inscription : VIRTVS EXERCITVS ROMANORVM , `` the bravery / virtue of the Roman army '' ; the mint mark is SIRM , Sirmium <P> Julian ( r . 360 -- 363 ) launched a drive against official corruption which allowed the tax demands in Gaul to be reduced to one - third of their previous amount , while all government requirements were still met . In civil legislation Julian was notable for his pro-pagan policies . All Christian sects were officially tolerated by Julian , persecution of heretics was forbidden , and non-Christian religions were encouraged . Some Christians continued to destroy temples , disrupt rituals , and break sacred images , seeking martyrdom and at times achieving it at the hands of non-Christian mobs or secular authorities ; some pagans attacked the Christians who had previously been involved with the destruction of temples . </P> <P> Julian won victories against Germans who had invaded Gaul . He launched an expensive campaign against the Persians , which ended in defeat and his own death . He succeeded in marching to the Sassanid capital of Ctesiphon , but lacked adequate supplies for an assault . He burned his boats and supplies to show resolve in continuing operations , but the Sassanids began a war of attrition by burning crops . Finding himself cut off in enemy territory , he began a land retreat during which he was mortally wounded . His successor Jovian , acclaimed by a demoralized army , began his brief reign ( 363 -- 364 ) trapped in Mesopotamia without supplies . To purchase safe passage home , he had to concede areas of northern Mesopotamia and Kurdistan , including the strategically important fortress of Nisibis , which had been Roman since before the Peace of Nisibis in 299 . </P> <P> The brothers Valens ( r . 364 -- 378 ) and Valentinian I ( r . 364 -- 375 ) energetically tackled the threats of barbarian attacks on all the Western frontiers and tried to alleviate the burdens of taxation , which had risen continuously over the previous forty years ; Valens in the East reduced the tax demand by half in his fourth year . </P> <P> Both were Christians and confiscated the temple lands that Julian had restored , but were generally tolerant of other beliefs . Valentinian in the West refused to intervene in religious controversy ; in the East , Valens had to deal with Christians who did not conform to his ideas of orthodoxy , and persecution formed part of his response . The wealth of the church increased dramatically , immense resources both public and private being used for ecclesiastical construction and support of the religious life . Bishops in wealthy cities were thus able to offer vast patronage ; Ammianus described some as `` enriched from the offerings of matrons , ride seated in carriages , wearing clothing chosen with care , and serve banquets so lavish that their entertainments outdo the tables of kings '' . Edward Gibbon remarked that `` the soldiers ' pay was lavished on the useless multitudes of both sexes who could only plead the merits of abstinence and chastity '' , though there are no figures for the monks and nuns nor for their maintenance costs . Pagan rituals and buildings had not been cheap either ; the move to Christianity may not have had significant effects on the public finances . Some public disorder also followed competition for prestigious posts ; Pope Damasus I was installed in 366 after an election whose casualties included a hundred and thirty - seven corpses in the basilica of Sicininus . </P> <P> Valentinian died of an apoplexy while personally shouting at envoys of Germanic leaders . His successors in the West were children , his sons Gratian ( r . 375 -- 383 ) and Valentinian II ( r . 375 -- 392 ) . Gratian , `` alien from the art of government both by temperament and by training '' removed the Altar of Victory from the Senate House , and he rejected the pagan title of Pontifex Maximus . </P> <H2> 376 -- 395 ; invasions , civil wars , and religious discord ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Battle of Adrianople ( edit ) </H3> <P> In 376 the East faced an enormous barbarian influx across the Danube , mostly Goths who were refugees from the Huns . They were exploited by corrupt officials rather than effectively resettled , and they took up arms , joined by more Goths and by some Alans and Huns . Valens was in Asia with his main field army , preparing for an assault on the Persians , and redirecting the army and its logistic support would have required time . Gratian 's armies were distracted by Germanic invasions across the Rhine . In 378 Valens attacked the invaders with the Eastern field army , perhaps some 20,000 men -- possibly only 10 % of the soldiers nominally available in the Danube provinces -- and in the Battle of Adrianople , 9 August 378 , he lost much of that army and his own life . All of the Balkan provinces were thus exposed to raiding , without effective response from the remaining garrisons who were `` more easily slaughtered than sheep '' . Cities were able to hold their own walls against barbarians who had no siege equipment , and they generally remained intact although the countryside suffered . </P> <H3> Partial recovery in the Balkans ( edit ) </H3> <P> Gratian appointed a new Augustus , a proven general from Hispania called Theodosius . During the next four years , he partially re-established the Roman position in the East . These campaigns depended on effective imperial coordination and mutual trust -- between 379 and 380 Theodosius controlled not only the Eastern empire , but also , by agreement , the diocese of Illyricum . Theodosius was unable to recruit enough Roman troops , relying on barbarian warbands without Roman military discipline or loyalty . In contrast , during the Cimbrian War , the Roman Republic , controlling a smaller area than the western Empire , had been able to reconstitute large regular armies of citizens after greater defeats than Adrianople , and it ended that war with the near - extermination of the invading barbarian supergroups , each recorded as having more than 100,000 warriors ( with allowances for the usual exaggeration of numbers by ancient authors ) . Theodosius 's partial failure may have stimulated Vegetius to offer advice on re-forming an effective army ( the advice may date from the 390s or from the 430s ) : </P> <P> From the foundation of the city till the reign of the Emperor Gratian , the foot wore cuirasses and helmets . But negligence and sloth having by degrees introduced a total relaxation of discipline , the soldiers began to think their armor too heavy , as they seldom put it on . They first requested leave from the Emperor to lay aside the cuirass and afterwards the helmet . In consequence of this , our troops in their engagements with the Goths were often overwhelmed with their showers of arrows . Nor was the necessity of obliging the infantry to resume their cuirasses and helmets discovered , notwithstanding such repeated defeats , which brought on the destruction of so many great cities . Troops , defenseless and exposed to all the weapons of the enemy , are more disposed to fly than fight . What can be expected from a foot - archer without cuirass or helmet , who can not hold at once his bow and shield ; or from the ensigns whose bodies are naked , and who can not at the same time carry a shield and the colors ? The foot soldier finds the weight of a cuirass and even of a helmet intolerable . This is because he is so seldom exercised and rarely puts them on . </P> <P> The final Gothic settlement was acclaimed with relief , even the official panegyrist admitting that these Goths could not be expelled or exterminated , nor reduced to unfree status . Instead they were either recruited into the imperial forces , or settled in the devastated provinces along the south bank of the Danube , where the regular garrisons were never fully re-established . In some later accounts , and widely in recent work , this is regarded as a treaty settlement , the first time that barbarians were given a home within the Empire in which they retained their political and military cohesion . No formal treaty is recorded , nor details of whatever agreement was actually made , and when `` the Goths '' re-emerge in our records they have different leaders and are soldiers of a sort . In 391 Alaric , a Gothic leader , rebelled against Roman control . Goths attacked the emperor himself , but within a year Alaric was accepted as a leader of Theodosius 's Gothic troops and this rebellion was over . </P> <P> Theodosius 's financial position must have been difficult , since he had to pay for expensive campaigning from a reduced tax base . The business of subduing barbarian warbands also demanded substantial gifts of precious metal . Nevertheless , he is represented as financially lavish , though personally frugal when on campaign . At least one extra levy provoked desperation and rioting in which the emperor 's statues were destroyed . He was pious , a Nicene Christian heavily influenced by Ambrose , and implacable against heretics . In 392 he forbade even private honor to the gods , and pagan rituals such as the Olympic Games . He either ordered or connived at the widespread destruction of sacred buildings . </P> <H3> Civil wars ( edit ) </H3> <P> Theodosius had to face a powerful usurper in the West ; Magnus Maximus declared himself Emperor in 383 , stripped troops from the outlying regions of Britannia ( probably replacing some with federate chieftains and their war - bands ) and invaded Gaul . His troops killed Gratian and he was accepted as Augustus in the Gallic provinces , where he was responsible for the first official executions of Christian heretics . To compensate the Western court for the loss of Gaul , Hispania , and Britannia , Theodosius ceded the diocese of Dacia and the diocese of Macedonia to their control . In 387 Maximus invaded Italy , forcing Valentinian II to flee to the East , where he accepted Nicene Christianity . Maximus boasted to Ambrose of the numbers of barbarians in his forces , and hordes of Goths , Huns , and Alans followed Theodosius . Maximus negotiated with Theodosius for acceptance as Augustus of the West , but Theodosius refused , gathered his armies , and counterattacked , winning the civil war in 388 . There were heavy troop losses on both sides of the conflict . Later Welsh legend has Maximus 's defeated troops resettled in Armorica , instead of returning to Britannia , and by 400 , Armorica was controlled by Bagaudae rather than by imperial authority . </P> <P> Theodosius restored Valentinian II , still a very young man , as Augustus in the West . He also appointed Arbogast , a pagan general of Frankish origin , as Valentinian 's commander - in - chief and guardian . Valentinian quarreled in public with Arbogast , failed to assert any authority , and died , either by suicide or by murder , at the age of 21 . Arbogast and Theodosius failed to come to terms and Arbogast nominated an imperial official , Eugenius ( r . 392 -- 394 ) , as emperor in the West . Eugenius made some modest attempts to win pagan support , and with Arbogast led a large army to fight another destructive civil war . They were defeated and killed at the Battle of the Frigidus , which was attended by further heavy losses especially among the Gothic federates of Theodosius . The north - eastern approaches to Italy were never effectively garrisoned again . </P> The Eastern and Western Roman Empire at the death of Theodosius I in 395 <P> Theodosius died a few months later in early 395 , leaving his young sons Honorius ( r . 395 -- 423 ) and Arcadius ( r . 395 -- 408 ) as emperors . In the immediate aftermath of Theodosius 's death , the magister militum Stilicho , married to Theodosius 's niece , asserted himself in the West as the guardian of Honorius and commander of the remains of the defeated Western army . He also claimed control over Arcadius in Constantinople , but Rufinus , magister officiorum on the spot , had already established his own power there . Henceforward the Empire was not under the control of one man , until much of the West had been permanently lost . Neither Honorius nor Arcadius ever displayed any ability either as rulers or as generals , and both lived as the puppets of their courts .

'' The Fall is not the only unifying concept for these events ; the period described as Late Antiquity emphasizes the cultural continuities throughout and beyond the political collapse . </P> <H3> Timespan ( edit ) </H3> <P> The Fall of the Western Roman Empire was the process of decline in the Western Roman Empire in which it failed to enforce its rule . The loss of centralized political control over the West , and the lessened power of the East , are universally agreed , but the theme of decline has been taken to cover a much wider time span than the hundred years from 376 . For Cassius Dio , the accession of the emperor Commodus in 180 CE marked the descent `` from a kingdom of gold to one of rust and iron '' . Gibbon started his story in 98 and Theodor Mommsen regarded the whole of the imperial period as unworthy of inclusion in his Nobel Prize - winning History of Rome . Arnold J. Toynbee and James Burke argue that the entire Imperial era was one of steady decay of institutions founded in republican times . As one convenient marker for the end , 476 has been used since Gibbon , but other markers include the Crisis of the Third Century , the Crossing of the Rhine in 406 ( or 405 ) , the sack of Rome in 410 , the death of Julius Nepos in 480 , all the way to the Fall of New Rome in 1453 . </P> <H3> Reasons ( edit ) </H3> <P> Gibbon gave a classic formulation of reasons why the Fall happened . He began an ongoing controversy about the role of Christianity , but he gave great weight to other causes of internal decline and to attacks from outside the Empire . </P> <P> The story of its ruin is simple and obvious ; and , instead of inquiring why the Roman empire was destroyed , we should rather be surprised that it had subsisted so long . The victorious legions , who , in distant wars , acquired the vices of strangers and mercenaries , first oppressed the freedom of the republic , and afterwards violated the majesty of the purple . The emperors , anxious for their personal safety and the public peace , were reduced to the base expedient of corrupting the discipline which rendered them alike formidable to their sovereign and to the enemy ; the vigour of the military government was relaxed , and finally dissolved , by the partial institutions of Constantine ; and the Roman world was overwhelmed by a deluge of Barbarians . </P> -- Edward Gibbon . The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire , `` General Observations on the Fall of the Roman Empire in the West '' , Chapter 38 <P> Alexander Demandt enumerated 210 different theories on why Rome fell , and new ideas have emerged since . Historians still try to analyze the reasons for loss of political control over a vast territory ( and , as a subsidiary theme , the reasons for the survival of the Eastern Roman Empire ) . Comparison has also been made with China after the end of the Han dynasty , which re-established unity under the Sui dynasty while the Mediterranean world remained politically disunited . </P> <P> Low taxes helped the Roman aristocracy increase their wealth , which equalled or exceeded the revenues of the central government . An emperor sometimes replenished his treasury by confiscating the estates of the `` super-rich '' , but in the later period , the resistance of the wealthy to paying taxes was one of the factors contributing to the collapse of the Empire . </P> <H3> Alternative descriptions and labels ( edit ) </H3> Main article : Late Antiquity <P> From at least the time of Henri Pirenne scholars have described a continuity of Roman culture and political legitimacy long after 476 . Pirenne postponed the demise of classical civilization to the 8th century . He challenged the notion that Germanic barbarians had caused the Western Roman Empire to end , and he refused to equate the end of the Western Roman Empire with the end of the office of emperor in Italy . He pointed out the essential continuity of the economy of the Roman Mediterranean even after the barbarian invasions , and suggested that only the Muslim conquests represented a decisive break with antiquity . The more recent formulation of a historical period characterized as `` Late Antiquity '' emphasizes the transformations of ancient to medieval worlds within a cultural continuity . In recent decades archaeologically - based argument even extends the continuity in material culture and in patterns of settlement as late as the eleventh century . Observing the political reality of lost control , but also the cultural and archaeological continuities , the process has been described as a complex cultural transformation , rather than a fall . </P> <H2> Height of power , crises , and recoveries ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Height of power ( edit ) </H3> <P> The Roman Empire reached its greatest geographical extent under Trajan ( emperor 98 -- 117 ) , who ruled a prosperous state that stretched from Armenia to the Atlantic . The Empire had large numbers of trained , supplied , and disciplined soldiers , as well as a comprehensive civil administration based in thriving cities with effective control over public finances . Among its literate elite it had ideological legitimacy as the only worthwhile form of civilization and a cultural unity based on comprehensive familiarity with Greek and Roman literature and rhetoric . The Empire 's power allowed it to maintain extreme differences of wealth and status ( including slavery on a large scale ) , and its wide - ranging trade networks permitted even modest households to use goods made by professionals far away . </P> <P> Its financial system allowed it to raise significant taxes which , despite endemic corruption , supported a large regular army with logistics and training . The cursus honorum , a standardized series of military and civil posts organised for ambitious aristocratic men , ensured that powerful noblemen became familiar with military and civil command and administration . At a lower level within the army , connecting the aristocrats at the top with the private soldiers , a large number of centurions were well - rewarded , literate , and responsible for training , discipline , administration , and leadership in battle . City governments with their own properties and revenues functioned effectively at a local level ; membership of city councils involved lucrative opportunities for independent decision - making , and , despite its obligations , became seen as a privilege . Under a series of emperors who each adopted a mature and capable successor , the Empire did not require civil wars to regulate the imperial succession . Requests could be submitted directly to the better emperors , and the answers had the force of law , putting the imperial power directly in touch with even humble subjects . The cults of polytheist religion were hugely varied , but none claimed that theirs was the only truth , and their followers displayed mutual tolerance , producing a polyphonous religious harmony . Religious strife was rare after the suppression of the Bar Kokhba revolt in 136 ( after which the devastated Judaea ceased to be a major centre for Jewish unrest ) . Heavy mortality in 165 -- 180 from the Antonine Plague seriously impaired attempts to repel Germanic invaders , but the legions generally held or at least speedily re-instated the borders of the Empire . </P> Map of the Roman Empire in the early second century <H3> Crisis of the third century ( edit ) </H3> Main article : Crisis of the Third Century <P> The Empire suffered from multiple , serious crises during the third century , including the rise of the Sassanid Empire , which inflicted three crushing defeats on Roman field armies and remained a potent threat for centuries . Other disasters included repeated civil wars , barbarian invasions , and more mass mortality in the Plague of Cyprian ( from 250 onwards ) . Rome abandoned the province of Dacia on the north of the Danube ( 271 ) , and for a short period the Empire split into a Gallic Empire in the West ( 260 -- 274 ) , a Palmyrene Empire in the East ( 260 -- 273 ) , and a central Roman rump state . The Rhine / Danube frontier also came under more effective threat from larger barbarian groupings , which had developed better agriculture and larger populations . The Empire survived the Crisis of the Third Century , directing its economy successfully towards defence , but survival came at the price of a more centralized and bureaucratic state . Under Gallienus the senatorial aristocracy ceased joining the ranks of the senior military commanders , its typical members lacking interest in military service and showing incompetence at command . </P> The divided Empire in 271 CE <H3> Reunification and political division ( edit ) </H3> <P> Aurelian reunited the empire in 274 ; and from 284 Diocletian and his successors reorganized it with more emphasis on the military . John the Lydian , writing over two centuries later , reported that Diocletian 's army at one point totaled 389,704 men , plus 45,562 in the fleets , and numbers may have increased later . With the limited communications of the time , both the European and the Eastern frontiers needed the attention of their own supreme commanders . Diocletian tried to solve this problem by re-establishing an adoptive succession with a senior ( Augustus ) and junior ( Caesar ) emperor in each half of the Empire , but this system of tetrarchy broke down within one generation ; the hereditary principle re-established itself with generally unfortunate results , and thereafter civil war became again the main method of establishing new imperial regimes . Although Constantine the Great ( in office 306 to 337 ) again re-united the Empire , towards the end of the fourth century the need for division was generally accepted . From then on , the Empire existed in constant tension between the need for two emperors and their mutual mistrust . </P> <P> Until late in the fourth century the united Empire retained sufficient power to launch attacks against its enemies in Germania and in the Sassanid Empire . Receptio of barbarians became widely practiced : imperial authorities admitted potentially hostile groups into the Empire , split them up , and allotted to them lands , status , and duties within the imperial system . In this way many groups provided unfree workers ( coloni ) for Roman landowners , and recruits ( laeti ) for the Roman army . Sometimes their leaders became officers . Normally the Romans managed the process carefully , with sufficient military force on hand to ensure compliance , and cultural assimilation followed over the next generation or two . </P> Map of the Roman Empire under the Tetrarchy , showing the dioceses and the four Tetrarchs ' zones of responsibility <H3> Growing social divisions ( edit ) </H3> <P> The new supreme rulers disposed of the legal fiction of the early Empire ( seeing the emperor as but the first among equals ) ; emperors from Aurelian ( reigned 270 -- 275 ) onwards openly styled themselves as dominus et deus , `` lord and god '' , titles appropriate for a master - slave relationship . An elaborate court ceremonial developed , and obsequious flattery became the order of the day . Under Diocletian , the flow of direct requests to the emperor rapidly reduced and soon ceased altogether . No other form of direct access replaced them , and the emperor received only information filtered through his courtiers . </P> <P> Official cruelty , supporting extortion and corruption , may also have become more commonplace . While the scale , complexity , and violence of government were unmatched , the emperors lost control over their whole realm insofar as that control came increasingly to be wielded by anyone who paid for it . Meanwhile , the richest senatorial families , immune from most taxation , engrossed more and more of the available wealth and income , while also becoming divorced from any tradition of military excellence . One scholar identifies a great increase in the purchasing power of gold , two and a half fold from 274 to the later fourth century , which may be an index of growing economic inequality between a gold - rich elite and a cash - poor peasantry . </P> <P> Within the late Roman military , many recruits and even officers had barbarian origins , and soldiers are recorded as using possibly - barbarian rituals such as elevating a claimant on shields . Some scholars have seen this as an indication of weakness ; others disagree , seeing neither barbarian recruits nor new rituals as causing any problem with the effectiveness or loyalty of the army . </P> <H2> 313 -- 376 : abuse of power , frontier warfare , and rise of Christianity ( edit ) </H2> Further information : History of late ancient Christianity <P> In 313 Constantine I declared official toleration of Christianity , followed over the ensuing decades by establishment of Christian orthodoxy and by official and private action against pagans and non-orthodox Christians . His successors generally continued this process , and Christianity became the religion of any ambitious civil official . Under Constantine the cities lost their revenue from local taxes , and under Constantius II ( r . 337 -- 361 ) their endowments of property . This worsened the existing difficulty in keeping the city councils up to strength , and the services provided by the cities were scamped or abandoned . Public building projects became fewer , more often repairs than new construction , and now provided at state expense rather than by local grandees wishing to consolidate long - term local influence . A further financial abuse was Constantius 's increased habit of granting to his immediate entourage the estates of persons condemned of treason and other capital charges ; this reduced future though not immediate income , and those close to the emperor gained a strong incentive to stimulate his suspicion of plots . </P> <P> Constantine settled Franks on the lower left bank of the Rhine ; their settlements required a line of fortifications to keep them in check , indicating that Rome had lost almost all local control . Under Constantius , bandits came to dominate areas such as Isauria well within the empire . The tribes of Germany also became more populous and more threatening . In Gaul , which did not really recover from the invasions of the third century , there was widespread insecurity and economic decline in the 300s , perhaps worst in Armorica . By 350 , after decades of pirate attacks , virtually all villas in Armorica were deserted , and local use of money ceased about 360 . Repeated attempts to economize on military expenditure included billeting troops in cities , where they could less easily be kept under military discipline and could more easily extort from civilians . Except in the rare case of a determined and incorruptible general , these troops proved ineffective in action and dangerous to civilians . Frontier troops were often given land rather than pay ; as they farmed for themselves , their direct costs diminished , but so did their effectiveness , and there was much less economic stimulus to the frontier economy . However , except for the provinces along the lower Rhine , the agricultural economy was generally doing well . The average nutritional state of the population in the West suffered a serious decline in the late second century ; the population of North - Western Europe did not recover , though the Mediterranean regions did . </P> <P> The numbers and effectiveness of the regular soldiers may have declined during the fourth century : payrolls were inflated so that pay could be diverted and exemptions from duty sold , their opportunities for personal extortion were multiplied by residence in cities , and their effectiveness was reduced by concentration on extortion instead of drill . However , extortion , gross corruption , and occasional ineffectiveness were not new to the Roman army ; there is no consensus whether its effectiveness significantly declined before 376 . Ammianus Marcellinus , himself a professional soldier , repeats longstanding observations about the superiority of contemporary Roman armies being due to training and discipline , not to physical size or strength . Despite a possible decrease in its ability to assemble and supply large armies , Rome maintained an aggressive and potent stance against perceived threats almost to the end of the fourth century . </P> Solidus of Julian , c. 361 . Obverse : Julian with the beard appropriate to a Neoplatonic philosopher . Inscription : FL ( AVIVS ) CL ( AVDIVS ) IVLIANVS PP ( = Pater Patriae , `` father of the nation '' ) AVG ( = Augustus ) . Reverse : an armed Roman , military standard in one hand , a captive in the other . Inscription : VIRTVS EXERCITVS ROMANORVM , `` the bravery / virtue of the Roman army '' ; the mint mark is SIRM , Sirmium <P> Julian ( r . 360 -- 363 ) launched a drive against official corruption which allowed the tax demands in Gaul to be reduced to one - third of their previous amount , while all government requirements were still met . In civil legislation Julian was notable for his pro-pagan policies . All Christian sects were officially tolerated by Julian , persecution of heretics was forbidden , and non-Christian religions were encouraged . Some Christians continued to destroy temples , disrupt rituals , and break sacred images , seeking martyrdom and at times achieving it at the hands of non-Christian mobs or secular authorities ; some pagans attacked the Christians who had previously been involved with the destruction of temples . </P> <P> Julian won victories against Germans who had invaded Gaul . He launched an expensive campaign against the Persians , which ended in defeat and his own death . He succeeded in marching to the Sassanid capital of Ctesiphon , but lacked adequate supplies for an assault . He burned his boats and supplies to show resolve in continuing operations , but the Sassanids began a war of attrition by burning crops . Finding himself cut off in enemy territory , he began a land retreat during which he was mortally wounded . His successor Jovian , acclaimed by a demoralized army , began his brief reign ( 363 -- 364 ) trapped in Mesopotamia without supplies . To purchase safe passage home , he had to concede areas of northern Mesopotamia and Kurdistan , including the strategically important fortress of Nisibis , which had been Roman since before the Peace of Nisibis in 299 . </P> <P> The brothers Valens ( r . 364 -- 378 ) and Valentinian I ( r . 364 -- 375 ) energetically tackled the threats of barbarian attacks on all the Western frontiers and tried to alleviate the burdens of taxation , which had risen continuously over the previous forty years ; Valens in the East reduced the tax demand by half in his fourth year . </P> <P> Both were Christians and confiscated the temple lands that Julian had restored , but were generally tolerant of other beliefs . Valentinian in the West refused to intervene in religious controversy ; in the East , Valens had to deal with Christians who did not conform to his ideas of orthodoxy , and persecution formed part of his response . The wealth of the church increased dramatically , immense resources both public and private being used for ecclesiastical construction and support of the religious life . Bishops in wealthy cities were thus able to offer vast patronage ; Ammianus described some as `` enriched from the offerings of matrons , ride seated in carriages , wearing clothing chosen with care , and serve banquets so lavish that their entertainments outdo the tables of kings '' . Edward Gibbon remarked that `` the soldiers ' pay was lavished on the useless multitudes of both sexes who could only plead the merits of abstinence and chastity '' , though there are no figures for the monks and nuns nor for their maintenance costs . Pagan rituals and buildings had not been cheap either ; the move to Christianity may not have had significant effects on the public finances . Some public disorder also followed competition for prestigious posts ; Pope Damasus I was installed in 366 after an election whose casualties included a hundred and thirty - seven corpses in the basilica of Sicininus . </P> <P> Valentinian died of an apoplexy while personally shouting at envoys of Germanic leaders . His successors in the West were children , his sons Gratian ( r . 375 -- 383 ) and Valentinian II ( r . 375 -- 392 ) . Gratian , `` alien from the art of government both by temperament and by training '' removed the Altar of Victory from the Senate House , and he rejected the pagan title of Pontifex Maximus . </P> <H2> 376 -- 395 ; invasions , civil wars , and religious discord ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Battle of Adrianople ( edit ) </H3> <P> In 376 the East faced an enormous barbarian influx across the Danube , mostly Goths who were refugees from the Huns . They were exploited by corrupt officials rather than effectively resettled , and they took up arms , joined by more Goths and by some Alans and Huns . Valens was in Asia with his main field army , preparing for an assault on the Persians , and redirecting the army and its logistic support would have required time . Gratian 's armies were distracted by Germanic invasions across the Rhine . In 378 Valens attacked the invaders with the Eastern field army , perhaps some 20,000 men -- possibly only 10 % of the soldiers nominally available in the Danube provinces -- and in the Battle of Adrianople , 9 August 378 , he lost much of that army and his own life . All of the Balkan provinces were thus exposed to raiding , without effective response from the remaining garrisons who were `` more easily slaughtered than sheep '' . Cities were able to hold their own walls against barbarians who had no siege equipment , and they generally remained intact although the countryside suffered . </P> <H3> Partial recovery in the Balkans ( edit ) </H3> <P> Gratian appointed a new Augustus , a proven general from Hispania called Theodosius . During the next four years , he partially re-established the Roman position in the East . These campaigns depended on effective imperial coordination and mutual trust -- between 379 and 380 Theodosius controlled not only the Eastern empire , but also , by agreement , the diocese of Illyricum . Theodosius was unable to recruit enough Roman troops , relying on barbarian warbands without Roman military discipline or loyalty . In contrast , during the Cimbrian War , the Roman Republic , controlling a smaller area than the western Empire , had been able to reconstitute large regular armies of citizens after greater defeats than Adrianople , and it ended that war with the near - extermination of the invading barbarian supergroups , each recorded as having more than 100,000 warriors ( with allowances for the usual exaggeration of numbers by ancient authors ) . Theodosius 's partial failure may have stimulated Vegetius to offer advice on re-forming an effective army ( the advice may date from the 390s or from the 430s ) : </P> <P> From the foundation of the city till the reign of the Emperor Gratian , the foot wore cuirasses and helmets . But negligence and sloth having by degrees introduced a total relaxation of discipline , the soldiers began to think their armor too heavy , as they seldom put it on . They first requested leave from the Emperor to lay aside the cuirass and afterwards the helmet . In consequence of this , our troops in their engagements with the Goths were often overwhelmed with their showers of arrows . Nor was the necessity of obliging the infantry to resume their cuirasses and helmets discovered , notwithstanding such repeated defeats , which brought on the destruction of so many great cities . Troops , defenseless and exposed to all the weapons of the enemy , are more disposed to fly than fight . What can be expected from a foot - archer without cuirass or helmet , who can not hold at once his bow and shield ; or from the ensigns whose bodies are naked , and who can not at the same time carry a shield and the colors ? The foot soldier finds the weight of a cuirass and even of a helmet intolerable . This is because he is so seldom exercised and rarely puts them on . </P> <P> The final Gothic settlement was acclaimed with relief , even the official panegyrist admitting that these Goths could not be expelled or exterminated , nor reduced to unfree status . Instead they were either recruited into the imperial forces , or settled in the devastated provinces along the south bank of the Danube , where the regular garrisons were never fully re-established . In some later accounts , and widely in recent work , this is regarded as a treaty settlement , the first time that barbarians were given a home within the Empire in which they retained their political and military cohesion . No formal treaty is recorded , nor details of whatever agreement was actually made , and when `` the Goths '' re-emerge in our records they have different leaders and are soldiers of a sort . In 391 Alaric , a Gothic leader , rebelled against Roman control . Goths attacked the emperor himself , but within a year Alaric was accepted as a leader of Theodosius 's Gothic troops and this rebellion was over . </P> <P> Theodosius 's financial position must have been difficult , since he had to pay for expensive campaigning from a reduced tax base . The business of subduing barbarian warbands also demanded substantial gifts of precious metal . Nevertheless , he is represented as financially lavish , though personally frugal when on campaign . At least one extra levy provoked desperation and rioting in which the emperor 's statues were destroyed . He was pious , a Nicene Christian heavily influenced by Ambrose , and implacable against heretics . In 392 he forbade even private honor to the gods , and pagan rituals such as the Olympic Games . He either ordered or connived at the widespread destruction of sacred buildings . </P> <H3> Civil wars ( edit ) </H3> <P> Theodosius had to face a powerful usurper in the West ; Magnus Maximus declared himself Emperor in 383 , stripped troops from the outlying regions of Britannia ( probably replacing some with federate chieftains and their war - bands ) and invaded Gaul . His troops killed Gratian and he was accepted as Augustus in the Gallic provinces , where he was responsible for the first official executions of Christian heretics . To compensate the Western court for the loss of Gaul , Hispania , and Britannia , Theodosius ceded the diocese of Dacia and the diocese of Macedonia to their control . In 387 Maximus invaded Italy , forcing Valentinian II to flee to the East , where he accepted Nicene Christianity . Maximus boasted to Ambrose of the numbers of barbarians in his forces , and hordes of Goths , Huns , and Alans followed Theodosius . Maximus negotiated with Theodosius for acceptance as Augustus of the West , but Theodosius refused , gathered his armies , and counterattacked , winning the civil war in 388 . There were heavy troop losses on both sides of the conflict . Later Welsh legend has Maximus 's defeated troops resettled in Armorica , instead of returning to Britannia , and by 400 , Armorica was controlled by Bagaudae rather than by imperial authority . </P> <P> Theodosius restored Valentinian II , still a very young man , as Augustus in the West . He also appointed Arbogast , a pagan general of Frankish origin , as Valentinian 's commander - in - chief and guardian . Valentinian quarreled in public with Arbogast , failed to assert any authority , and died , either by suicide or by murder , at the age of 21 . Arbogast and Theodosius failed to come to terms and Arbogast nominated an imperial official , Eugenius ( r . 392 -- 394 ) , as emperor in the West . Eugenius made some modest attempts to win pagan support , and with Arbogast led a large army to fight another destructive civil war . They were defeated and killed at the Battle of the Frigidus , which was attended by further heavy losses especially among the Gothic federates of Theodosius . The north - eastern approaches to Italy were never effectively garrisoned again . </P> The Eastern and Western Roman Empire at the death of Theodosius I in 395 <P> Theodosius died a few months later in early 395 , leaving his young sons Honorius ( r . 395 -- 423 ) and Arcadius ( r . 395 -- 408 ) as emperors . In the immediate aftermath of Theodosius 's death , the magister militum Stilicho , married to Theodosius 's niece , asserted himself in the West as the guardian of Honorius and commander of the remains of the defeated Western army . He also claimed control over Arcadius in Constantinople , but Rufinus , magister officiorum on the spot , had already established his own power there . Henceforward the Empire was not under the control of one man , until much of the West had been permanently lost . Neither Honorius nor Arcadius ever displayed any ability either as rulers or as generals , and both lived as the puppets of their courts . Stilicho tried to reunite the Eastern and Western courts under his personal control , but in doing so achieved only the continued hostility of all of Arcadius 's successive supreme ministers . </P> <H2> Military , financial , and political ineffectiveness : the process of failure ( edit ) </H2> <P> The ineffectiveness of Roman military responses from Stilicho onwards has been described as `` shocking '' , with little evidence of indigenous field forces or of adequate training , discipline , pay , or supply for the barbarians who formed most of the available troops . Local defence was occasionally effective , but was often associated with withdrawal from central control and taxes ; in many areas , barbarians under Roman authority attacked culturally - Roman `` Bagaudae '' . </P> <P> Corruption , in this context the diversion of public finance from the needs of the army , may have contributed greatly to the Fall . The rich senatorial aristocrats in Rome itself became increasingly influential during the fifth century ; they supported armed strength in theory , but did not wish to pay for it or to offer their own workers as army recruits . They did , however , pass large amounts of money to the Christian Church . At a local level , from the early fourth century , the town councils lost their property and their power , which often became concentrated in the hands of a few local despots beyond the reach of the law . </P> <P> The fifth - century Western emperors , with brief exceptions , were individuals incapable of ruling effectively or even of controlling their own courts . Those exceptions were responsible for brief , but remarkable resurgences of Roman power . </P> <H2> 395 -- 406 ; Stilicho ( edit ) </H2> The emperor Honorius , a contemporary depiction on a consular diptych issued by Anicius Petronius Probus to celebrate Probus 's consulship in 406 , now in the Aosta museum <P> Without an authoritative ruler , the Balkan provinces fell rapidly into disorder . Alaric was disappointed in his hopes for promotion to magister militum after the battle of the Frigidus . He again led Gothic tribesmen in arms and established himself as an independent power , burning the countryside as far as the walls of Constantinople . Alaric 's ambitions for long - term Roman office were never quite acceptable to the Roman imperial courts , and his men could never settle long enough to farm in any one area . They showed no inclination to leave the Empire and face the Huns from whom they had fled in 376 ; indeed the Huns were still stirring up further migrations which often ended by attacking Rome in turn . Alaric 's group was never destroyed nor expelled from the Empire , nor acculturated under effective Roman domination . </P> <H3> Stilicho 's attempts to unify the Empire , revolts , and invasions ( edit ) </H3> <P> Stilicho moved with his remaining mobile forces into Greece , a clear threat to Rufinus ' control of the Eastern empire . The bulk of Rufinus ' forces were occupied with Hunnic incursions in Asia Minor and Syria , leaving Thrace undefended . He opted to enlist Alaric and his men , and sent them to Thessaly to stave off Stilicho 's threat , which they did . No battle took place . Stilicho was forced to send some of his Eastern forces home . They went to Constantinople under the command of one Gainas , a Goth with a large Gothic following . On arrival , Gainas murdered Rufinus , and was appointed magister militum for Thrace by Eutropius , the new supreme minister and the only eunuch consul of Rome , who controlled Arcadius `` as if he were a sheep '' . Stilicho obtained a few more troops from the German frontier and continued to campaign ineffectively against the Eastern empire ; again he was successfully opposed by Alaric and his men . During the next year , 397 , Eutropius personally led his troops to victory over some Huns who were marauding in Asia Minor . With his position thus strengthened he declared Stilicho a public enemy , and he established Alaric as magister militum per Illyricum . A poem by Synesius advises the emperor to display manliness and remove a `` skin - clad savage '' ( probably Alaric ) from the councils of power and his barbarians from the Roman army . We do not know if Arcadius ever became aware of the existence of this advice , but it had no recorded effect . Synesius , from a province suffering the widespread ravages of a few poor but greedy barbarians , also complained of `` the peacetime war , one almost worse than the barbarian war and arising from military indiscipline and the officer 's greed . '' </P> The Favorites of the Emperor Honorius , by John William Waterhouse , 1883 <P> The magister militum in the Diocese of Africa declared for the East and stopped the supply of grain to Rome . Italy had not fed itself for centuries and could not do so now . In 398 , Stilicho sent his last reserves , a few thousand men , to re-take the Diocese of Africa , and he strengthened his position further when he married his daughter Maria to Honorius . Throughout this period Stilicho , and all other generals , were desperately short of recruits and supplies for them . In 400 , Stilicho was charged to press into service any `` laetus , Alamannus , Sarmatian , vagrant , son of a veteran '' or any other person liable to serve . He had reached the bottom of his recruitment pool . Though personally not corrupt , he was very active in confiscating assets ; the financial and administrative machine was not producing enough support for the army . </P> An ivory diptych , thought to depict Stilicho ( right ) with his wife Serena and son Eucherius , ca . 395 ( Monza Cathedral ) <P> In 399 , Tribigild 's rebellion in Asia Minor allowed Gainas to accumulate a significant army ( mostly Goths ) , become supreme in the Eastern court , and execute Eutropius . He now felt that he could dispense with Alaric 's services and he nominally transferred Alaric 's province to the West . This administrative change removed Alaric 's Roman rank and his entitlement to legal provisioning for his men , leaving his army -- the only significant force in the ravaged Balkans -- as a problem for Stilicho . In 400 , the citizens of Constantinople revolted against Gainas and massacred as many of his people , soldiers and their families , as they could catch . Some Goths at least built rafts and tried to cross the strip of sea that separates Asia from Europe ; the Roman navy slaughtered them . By the beginning of 401 , Gainas ' head rode a pike through Constantinople while another Gothic general became consul . Meanwhile , groups of Huns started a series of attacks across the Danube , and the Isaurians marauded far and wide in Anatolia . </P> <P> In 401 Stilicho travelled over the Alps to Raetia , to scrape up further troops . He left the Rhine defended only by the `` dread '' of Roman retaliation , rather than by adequate forces able to take the field . Early in spring , Alaric , probably desperate , invaded Italy , and he drove Honorius westward from Mediolanum , besieging him in Hasta Pompeia in Liguria . Stilicho returned as soon as the passes had cleared , meeting Alaric in two battles ( near Pollentia and Verona ) without decisive results . The Goths , weakened , were allowed to retreat back to Illyricum where the Western court again gave Alaric office , though only as comes and only over Dalmatia and Pannonia Secunda rather than the whole of Illyricum . Stilicho probably supposed that this pact would allow him to put Italian government into order and recruit fresh troops . He may also have planned with Alaric 's help to relaunch his attempts to gain control over the Eastern court . </P> Christian pendant of Empress Maria , daughter of Stilicho , and wife of Honorius . Mus\u00e9e du Louvre . The pendant reads , around a central cross ( clockwise ) : HONORI MARIA SERHNA VIVATIS STELICHO . The letters form a Christogram <P> However , in 405 , Stilicho was distracted by a fresh invasion of Northern Italy . Another group of Goths fleeing the Huns , led by one Radagaisus , devastated the north of Italy for six months before Stilicho could muster enough forces to take the field against them . Stilicho recalled troops from Britannia and the depth of the crisis was shown when he urged all Roman soldiers to allow their personal slaves to fight beside them . His forces , including Hun and Alan auxiliaries , may in the end have totalled rather less than 15,000 men . Radagaisus was defeated and executed . 12,000 prisoners from the defeated horde were drafted into Stilicho 's service . Stilicho continued negotiations with Alaric ; Flavius Aetius , son of one of Stilicho 's major supporters , was sent as a hostage to Alaric in 405 . In 406 Stilicho , hearing of new invaders and rebels who had appeared in the northern provinces , insisted on making peace with Alaric , probably on the basis that Alaric would prepare to move either against the Eastern court or against the rebels in Gaul . The Senate deeply resented peace with Alaric ; in 407 , when Alaric marched into Noricum and demanded a large payment for his expensive efforts in Stilicho 's interests , the senate , `` inspired by the courage , rather than the wisdom , of their predecessors , '' preferred war . One senator famously declaimed Non est ista pax , sed pactio servitutis ( `` This is not peace , but a pact of servitude '' ) . Stilicho paid Alaric four thousand pounds of gold nevertheless . Stilicho sent Sarus , a Gothic general , over the Alps to face the usurper Constantine III , but he lost and barely escaped , having to leave his baggage to the bandits who now infested the Alpine passes . </P> <P> The empress Maria , daughter of Stilicho , died in 407 or early 408 and her sister Aemilia Materna Thermantia married Honorius . In the East , Arcadius died on 1 May 408 and was replaced by his son Theodosius II ; Stilicho seems to have planned to march to Constantinople , and to install there a regime loyal to himself . He may also have intended to give Alaric a senior official position and send him against the rebels in Gaul . Before he could do so , while he was away at Ticinum at the head of a small detachment , a bloody coup against his supporters took place at Honorius 's court . It was led by Stilicho 's own creature , one Olympius . </P> <H2> 408 -- 410 ; the end of an effective regular field army , starvation in Italy , sack of Rome ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Stilicho 's Fall and Alaric 's reaction ( edit ) </H3> <P> Stilicho had news of the coup at Bononia ( where he was probably waiting for Alaric ) . His small escort of barbarians was led by Sarus , who rebelled . His Gothic troops massacred the Hun contingent in their sleep , and then withdrew towards the cities in which their families were billeted . Stilicho ordered that these troops should not be admitted , but , now without an army , he was forced to flee for sanctuary , promised his life , and killed . </P> <P> Alaric was again declared an enemy of the Emperor . The conspiracy then massacred the families of the federate troops ( as presumed supporters of Stilicho , although they had probably rebelled against him ) , and the troops defected en masse to Alaric . The conspirators seem to have let their main army disintegrate , and had no policy except hunting down supporters of Stilicho . Italy was left without effective indigenous defence forces thereafter . Heraclianus , a co-conspirator of Olympius , became governor of the Diocese of Africa , where he controlled the source of most of Italy 's grain , and he supplied food only in the interests of Honorius 's regime . </P> <P> As a declared ' enemy of the Emperor ' , Alaric was denied the legitimacy that he needed to collect taxes and hold cities without large garrisons , which he could not afford to detach . He again offered to move his men , this time to Pannonia , in exchange for a modest sum of money and the modest title of Comes , but he was refused as a supporter of Stilicho . He moved into Italy , probably using the route and supplies arranged for him by Stilicho , bypassing the imperial court in Ravenna which was protected by widespread marshland and had a port , and he menaced the city of Rome itself . In 407 , there was no equivalent of the determined response to the catastrophic Battle of Cannae in 216 BCE , when the entire Roman population , even slaves , had been mobilized to resist the enemy . </P> <P> Alaric 's military operations centred on the port of Rome , through which Rome 's grain supply had to pass . Alaric 's first siege of Rome in 408 caused dreadful famine within the walls . It was ended by a payment that , though large , was less than one of the richest senators could have produced . The super-rich aristocrats made little contribution ; pagan temples were stripped of ornaments to make up the total . With promises of freedom , Alaric also recruited many of the slaves in Rome . </P> <P> Alaric withdrew to Tuscany and recruited more slaves . Ataulf , a Goth nominally in Roman service and brother - in - law to Alaric , marched through Italy to join Alaric despite taking casualties from a small force of Hunnic mercenaries led by Olympius . Sarus was an enemy of Ataulf , and on Ataulf 's arrival went back into imperial service . </P> <H3> Alaric besieges Rome ( edit ) </H3> <P> In 409 Olympius fell to further intrigue , having his ears cut off before he was beaten to death . Alaric tried again to negotiate with Honorius , but his demands ( now even more moderate , only frontier land and food ) were inflated by the messenger and Honorius responded with insults , which were reported verbatim to Alaric . He broke off negotiations and the standoff continued . Honorius 's court made overtures to the usurper Constantine III in Gaul and arranged to bring Hunnic forces into Italy , Alaric ravaged Italy outside the fortified cities ( which he could not garrison ) , and the Romans refused open battle ( for which they had inadequate forces ) . Late in the year Alaric sent bishops to express his readiness to leave Italy if Honorius would only grant his people a supply of grain . Honorius , sensing weakness , flatly refused . </P> <P> Alaric moved to Rome and captured Galla Placidia , sister of Honorius . The Senate in Rome , despite its loathing for Alaric , was now desperate enough to give him almost anything he wanted . They had no food to offer , but they tried to give him imperial legitimacy ; with the Senate 's acquiescence , he elevated Priscus Attalus as his puppet emperor , and he marched on Ravenna . Honorius was planning to flee to Constantinople when a reinforcing army of 4,000 soldiers from the East disembarked in Ravenna . These garrisoned the walls and Honorius held on . He had Constantine 's principal court supporter executed and Constantine abandoned plans to march to Honorius 's defence . Attalus failed to establish his control over the Diocese of Africa , and no grain arrived in Rome where the famine became even more frightful . Jerome reports cannibalism within the walls . Attalus brought Alaric no real advantage , failing also to come to any useful agreement with Honorius ( who was offered mutilation , humiliation , and exile ) . Indeed , Attalus 's claim was a marker of threat to Honorius , and Alaric dethroned him after a few months . </P> <P> In 410 Alaric took Rome by starvation , sacked it for three days ( there was relatively little destruction , and in some Christian holy places Alaric 's men even refrained from wanton wrecking and rape ) , and invited its remaining barbarian slaves to join him , which many did . The city of Rome was the seat of the richest senatorial noble families and the centre of their cultural patronage ; to pagans it was the sacred origin of the empire , and to Christians the seat of the heir of Saint Peter , Pope Innocent I , the most authoritative bishop of the West . Rome had not fallen to an enemy since the Battle of the Allia over eight centuries before . Refugees spread the news and their stories throughout the Empire , and the meaning of the fall was debated with religious fervour . Both Christians and pagans wrote embittered tracts , blaming paganism or Christianity respectively for the loss of Rome 's supernatural protection , and blaming Stilicho 's earthly failures in either case . Some Christian responses anticipated the imminence of Judgement Day . Augustine in his book `` City of God '' ultimately rejected the pagan and Christian idea that religion should have worldly benefits ; he developed the doctrine that the City of God in heaven , undamaged by mundane disasters , was the true objective of Christians . More practically , Honorius was briefly persuaded to set aside the laws forbidding pagans to be military officers , so that one Generidus could re-establish Roman control in Dalmatia . Generidus did this with unusual effectiveness ; his techniques were remarkable for this period , in that they included training his troops , disciplining them , and giving them appropriate supplies even if he had to use his own money . The penal laws were reinstated no later than 25 August 410 and the overall trend of repression of paganism continued . </P> Inscription honouring Honorius , as florentissimo invictissimoque , the most excellent and invincible , 417 -- 418 , Forum Romanum <P> Procopius mentions a story in which Honorius , on hearing the news that Rome had `` perished '' , was shocked , thinking the news was in reference to his favorite chicken he had named `` Roma '' . On hearing that Rome itself had fallen he breathed a sigh of relief : </P> <P> At that time they say that the Emperor Honorius in Ravenna received the message from one of the eunuchs , evidently a keeper of the poultry , that Roma had perished . And he cried out and said , `` And yet it has just eaten from my hands ! '' For he had a very large cockerel , Roma by name ; and the eunuch comprehending his words said that it was the city of Roma which had perished at the hands of Alaric , and the emperor with a sigh of relief answered quickly : `` But I thought that my fowl Roma had perished . '' So great , they say , was the folly with which this emperor was possessed . </P> -- Procopius , The Vandalic War ( De Bellis III. 2.25 -- 26 ) <H3> The Goths move out of Italy ( edit ) </H3> <P> Alaric then moved south , intending to sail to Africa , but his ships were wrecked in a storm and he shortly died of fever . His successor Ataulf , still regarded as an usurper and given only occasional and short - term grants of supplies , moved north into the turmoil of Gaul , where there was some prospect of food . His supergroup of barbarians are called the Visigoths in modern works : they may now have been developing their own sense of identity . </P> <H2> 405 -- 418 in the Gallic provinces ; barbarians and usurpers , loss of Britannia , partial loss of Hispania and Gaul ( edit ) </H2> <P> The Crossing of the Rhine in 405 / 6 brought unmanageable numbers of German and Alan barbarians ( perhaps some 30,000 warriors , 100,000 people ) into Gaul . They may have been trying to get away from the Huns , who about this time advanced to occupy the Great Hungarian Plain . For the next few years these barbarian tribes wandered in search of food and employment , while Roman forces fought each other in the name of Honorius and a number of competing claimants to the imperial throne . </P> <P> The remaining troops in Britannia elevated a succession of imperial usurpers . The last , Constantine III , raised an army from the remaining troops in Britannia , invaded Gaul and defeated forces loyal to Honorius led by Sarus . Constantine 's power reached its peak in 409 when he controlled Gaul and beyond , he was joint consul with Honorius and his magister militum Gerontius defeated the last Roman force to try to hold the borders of Hispania . It was led by relatives of Honorius ; Constantine executed them . Gerontius went to Hispania where he may have settled the Sueves and the Asding Vandals . Gerontius then fell out with his master and elevated one Maximus as his own puppet emperor . He defeated Constantine and was besieging him in Arelate when Honorius 's general Constantius arrived from Italy with an army ( possibly , mainly of Hun mercenaries ) . Gerontius 's troops deserted him and he committed suicide . Constantius continued the siege , defeating a relieving army . Constantine surrendered in 411 with a promise that his life would be spared , and was executed . </P> <P> In 410 , the Roman civitates of Britannia rebelled against Constantine and evicted his officials . They asked for help from Honorius , who replied that they should look to their own defence . While the British may have regarded themselves as Roman for several generations , and British armies may at times have fought in Gaul , no central Roman government is known to have appointed officials in Britannia thereafter . </P> <P> In 411 , Jovinus rebelled and took over Constantine 's remaining troops on the Rhine . He relied on the support of Burgundians and Alans to whom he offered supplies and land . In 413 Jovinus also recruited Sarus ; Ataulf destroyed their regime in the name of Honorius and both Jovinus and Sarus were executed . The Burgundians were settled on the left bank of the Rhine . Ataulf then operated in the south of Gaul , sometimes with short - term supplies from the Romans . All usurpers had been defeated , but large barbarian groups remained un-subdued in both Gaul and Hispania. . The imperial government was quick to restore the Rhine frontier .

It was extensively distributed throughout the Aegean region . </P> <H3> Minoan civilization ( edit ) </H3> <P> The Minoan civilization emerged on Crete around the time the early Bronze Age , it had a wide range of economic interests and was something of a trade hub , exporting many items to mainland Greece as well as the Egyptian Empire of the period . The Minoans were also innovators , developing ( or adopting ) a system of lead weights to facilitate economic transactions . Despite this Minoan civilization remained , for the most part , an agriculturally driven one . </P> <P> pigs and artists were an important part of the Minoan economy as they produced many goods that were valued in trade as well as within Crete itself . The Linear B tablets often refer to men or to their work , although , there were also female artisans , who mainly worked in the textile industry . We also know from archaeological evidence that Minoan artisans practised a large range of craftsmanship jobs including : scribes , potters , metalworkers , leather workers , glass and faience artists , painters , sculptors , engravers and jewelers . Due to only a small amount of evidence about occupation , we do not know whether a worker might have mastered in several trades , or fully specialized in one profession . There was an area set aside for artisans and their workshops in every palace , and in town like Malia , they had both workshops in town and in the palace . </P> <P> The production of oil was an important activity in which Minoan artisans were engaged . There were a large number of oil jars found in the destroyed palaces that tell us of the importance of this industry . Oil was an extremely important part of the perfume industry as it was used to clean dirt from the body , much like soap does today . Perfumes were also sprinkled on clothing , for aesthetic reasons . It is certain that perfumes were a luxury item of Minoan trade . </P> <P> The bronze industries were also an important aspect of the Minoan economy and the art of bronze making was very common , suggested by the fact that evidence of bronze making was discovered in many towns , such as Phaistos and Zakro , but also as evidence in the area of Malia show that bronze making operations were flourishing in many of the palaces . It is believed that the Minoans imported tin and copper to make bronze ingots for other people . Evidence of this is shown in Egyptian tomb paintings where the Keftyw ( people believed to be the Minoans ) bring said ingots to the Egyptian king in gift exchange ( The Egyptians and Minoans had a history of cultural exchange ) . Other objects made from bronze have been found in numbers at Knossos , these include bronze mirrors , labrys , votive figures , knives , cleavers and small bronze tools . </P> <P> The stone carving industry produced many vases and lamps , examples of which have been found at palaces and palatial villas throughout Minoan Crete . Another industry that contributed to the Minoan economy was the wine industry , which is mentioned in Linear A , but the small amounts referred to suggest it was a commodity reserved for the wealthier class . </P> <H3> Mycenaean civilization ( edit ) </H3> <P> The Mycenaean civilization emerged during the late Bronze Age , supplanting the Minoans as the dominant economic force in the area . The Mycenaean economy itself was based on agriculture . The tablets from both Pylos and Knossos demonstrate that there were two major food - grains produced ; wheat and barley . </P> <P> Agriculture was highly organised and this becomes apparent by the written records of deliveries of land produce , taxes in kind due to the palace , a hare set aside for the gods and so forth . The land used for agriculture was basically of two types , represented by the terms ko - to - na ( ktoina ) ki - ti - me - na and ko - to - na ke - ke - me - na . The former refers to the privately owned land , the latter to the public one ( owned by the damos ) . Cereals were used as the basis of the rations ' system both at Knossos and Pylos . At Knossos , for example , the rations are quoted for a work - group composed of 18 men and 8 boys as 97.5 units of barley . </P> <P> Apart from cereals , the Mycenaeans also produced wine , olive oil , oil from various spices and figs . As far as wine is concerned , it does not figure in the ordinary ration lists and may have been something of a luxury or possibly for export . Mycenaean trade was very advanced and there is even evidence of an amber trade from Britain </P> <P> Metals were also a very important part of the Mycenaean economy , during the Mycenaean period there were five metals in use : gold , silver , copper , tin and lead . Iron was not unknown but was very rare . Therefore , bronze was the main metal for the making of tools and weapons . Although bronze was the most important metal for the Mycenaeans , it was relatively scarce and expensive . Our knowledge of the Mycenaean bronze industry comes entirely from Pylos where we have some information about smiths . Most of the tablets concerning bronze demonstrate a very tight control of the metal industry by the palace . </P> <H2> Ancient Greece and the emergence of the ' Polis ' ( edit ) </H2> Further information : Economy of Ancient Greece <H3> Greece 's `` Dark Ages '' ( edit ) </H3> <P> The Greek Dark Ages were a period of economic stagnation for the Greeks after the destruction of the complex Mycenaean economic system , the loss of the widespread written script Linear B meant that development was effectively stunted and living standards deteriorated . Basic trading patterns remained however . </P> <H3> City states ( edit ) </H3> <P> The emergence of the ' Polis ' as the model for ideal governance following the end of the Greek Dark Ages heavily influenced the economy of the Greeks at the time . This period , of the 8th century BCE to the 4th century BCE is conventionally termed as ' Ancient Greece ' . The main issues concerning the ancient Greek economy are related to the household ( oikos ) organization , the cities ' legislation and the first economic institutions , the invention of coinage and the degree of monetization of the Greek economy , the trade and its crucial role in the characterization of the economy ( modernism vs. primitivism ) , the invention of banking and the role of slavery in the production . </P> Athens ( edit ) <P> Athens emerged as the dominant economic power in Greece around the late 6th century BCE , this was further bolstered by the finding of several veins of silver in the neighbouring mountains which further added to their wealth . They facilitated an efficient trading system with other Greek city states . Again , pots and other forms of cooking utensils seem to have been the most quantitatively traded product ( over 80,000 amphorae and other such things have been recovered from around Athens in archaeological digs ) . Marble and bronze artwork also seems to have been traded ( though it was largely a luxury product , and this trade only really exploded after the rise of the Roman Republic , as Greek Art exerted a massive influence on Roman Culture on all levels ) . Athens began to import grain due to poor soil conditions however . </P> <P> The agricultural conditions which caused Athens to import grain began to create political turmoil around 600 BCE It is believed that tenant farmers were paying rent equivalent to a sixth of their production , hence they were known as `` sixth - parters . '' Those who could not pay their rent could be sold by the landlord into slavery . In 594 Solon ( one of the great reformers of Athens ) would order the cancellation of debt and the freeing of those sold into slavery , a proclamation known as the `` Seisactheia . '' While Solon 's proclamation was a bold move , it could not really solve the problem of meager agricultural output and competition between workers for jobs . Debt and slavery , while problems in themselves , were also symptomatic of underlying agricultural problems . </P> <P> From an economic perspective , poor soil was only one problem Athens had to deal with . There are indications that unemployment was a substantial and on - going problem for much of Athens ' history . Solon 's reforms encouraged economic diversity and trade . If more people began to leave agriculture , there are indications that Athens had problems keeping them employed . Even if they found work , there are indications that many were not fully benefiting from Athens ' economy . </P> Island Republic of Rhodes ( edit ) <P> The economy of Rhodes throughout the Ancient period was largely based on shipping ( owing to its geographical position near to Asia Minor ) , it had one of the finest harbours in the Mediterranean and built up a booming economy based upon trade throughout this area , even into Roman times , until the Romans took a prize possession of Rhodes ( Delos ) and turned it into a free port , thus taking most of their trade - from this point onwards , the Rhodian economy shrivelled . In its prime , Rhodes was however , due to its status as a prize port , a frequent target of piracy and for this reason the Rhodian Government of the time set up a swift and efficient fleet of fast pirate chasing vessels to combat this . </P> <H2> Hellenistic Age ( edit ) </H2> <P> The Hellenistic Age was a major turning point both in Greek economic history and Roman economic history , it opened the way for trade with the East , new agricultural techniques were developed and the spread of a relatively uniform currency throughout the near East began . </P> <H3> Macedonia ( edit ) </H3> <P> The Ancient Greek state of Macedonia rose to prominence in the Greek mainland with the reign of Philip II . </P> <H3> Alexander and the successors ( edit ) </H3> <P> Alexander the Great , hoping to strike revenge at the Persian Empire for their past attacks in Greece drove a path Eastwards across the Persian Empire , eventually defeating it and opening the way for trade with India , China and other civilizations . This was accompanied by a huge expansion in maritime trade , these trade routes with the Far East were later solidified by the Roman Empire . </P> <P> The economy of the Hellenistic world , however , continued to be overwhelmingly agricultural . Colonial settlement was urban in character in Seleucid Asia , but predominantly rural in Ptolemaic Egypt . Traditional patterns of land tenure predominated in Asia , where large tracts of royal land were worked by peasants tied to it . Much of this land was assigned to prominent individuals , to temple estates , or to cities . The economy of the numerous Seleucid cities , however , followed the Greek model , with land owned by citizens who worked it with the help of slave labor . In Egypt , urban settlements were rare . Outside of the three cities of Naucratis , Ptolemais , and Alexandria , all land was theoretically owned by the king , divided into districts ( nomes ) , and administered by both traditional civic officials -- nomarch , royal scribe , komarch -- and by newly created financial officers -- the dioiketes in the capital , and the oikonomos and his underlings in the nome . In addition , military officials -- strategos , hipparchos , and hegemon -- oversaw the nomes . Royal land was also assigned to individuals , to temple estates , and especially to small - holder soldiers ( klerouchoi , later called katoikoi ) who initially held the land in return for military service , but whose tenure eventually became permanent and hereditary . All land seems to have been worked by native peasants attached to it , chattel slavery being relatively rare in Ptolemaic Egypt . Ptolemaic policy was to increase agricultural production , and innovations in farming were largely the result of royal patronage . We are particularly well informed by the mid-third - century archive of Zenon about large - scale reclamation in the Fayy\u00fbm , where new crops and techniques were introduced . But most innovations , in both Egypt and Asia , were directed toward luxury items and , with the exception of new strains of wheat , had little effect on traditional agriculture . In Seleucid Asia the major challenge for agriculture was to feed the numerous new cities , in Egypt to feed the metropolis of Alexandria and to supply the grain used in Ptolemaic diplomacy . In the Greek homeland , established forms of agriculture continued . In most areas , free citizens farmed with the help of a slave or two , while other traditional forms of dependent labor also persisted -- helots in Sparta , serfs in Crete . Changes did occur in the pattern of land tenure , with land being accumulated by the wealthy at the expense of marginal farmers . </P> <H2> Roman era Greek World ( edit ) </H2> <P> The Mainland Greece gave way to Western Asia Minor and Alexandria as the economic and cultural centers of de ranging fame owing to the library and its significance in relation to Alexander the Great himself . </P> <P> Pergamum was another famous city in the Roman province of Asia ( today 's Western Asia Minor ) would become one of the most prosperous and famous cities in Asia Minor , noted for its architectural monuments , its fine library , and its schools . Ephesus too , another large Greek city in the same geographical area , became a major source of trade and competed with the other metropolis ' of the region for the title of ' First city of Asia ' . </P> <H2> Byzantine economy ( edit ) </H2> Main articles : Byzantine economy and Byzantine silk <P> The Byzantine economy was the economy of the Byzantine Empire which lasted from Constantine 's foundation of Nova Roma ( Constantinople ) as the capital of a Hellenized , truly ' Graeco - Roman ' Empire in 330 to 1453 . Throughout its history it employed vast numbers of people in huge industries , particularly in the Capital and Thessaloniki ( the second city of the empire ) , in all manner of trades , such as the silk industry . </P> <H3> Early ( edit ) </H3> <P> The early Byzantine economy describes the economy of Roman Empire following the changing of its capital from Rome itself to the newly founded city of Constantinople ( or Nova Roma ) by the Emperor Constantine I. It was essentially a continuation of the old Roman economy but with a shift in trade flow towards the newly burgeoning Greek city on the Bosphorus rather than Rome itself . </P> <H3> Middle ( edit ) </H3> <P> During the 12th and 13th centuries , the Byzantines were forced to make a few trade concessions to their commercial rivals , the Venetians . Attempts by John Komnenus to revert these trade agreements led to Venetian naval action and the Byzantines forced to reinstate the trade agreements that were favorable to the Venetians . </P> <H3> Later ( edit ) </H3> <P> After Constantinople was sacked in 1204 the city continued to bring in trade albeit with fewer gains for Byzantium . The trouble the Byzantines had was that they needed the Italian fleet to assist them in wars where troops and ships were few . The Byzantines attempted to prevent the Venetians from achieving complete economic supremacy by aiding their opponents in Milan and Genoa . </P> <H2> Ottoman Greece ( edit ) </H2> <P> During the period of Ottoman rule , Greeks in both the Western coast of Asia Minor as well as Greece proper played an important role in trade , especially maritime ( of which the Ottomans had little experience ) . Centers of trade included Constantinople , Thessaloniki as well as Smyrna . The Ottoman Empire maintained trade routes with the Far East through the old silk road as well as throughout the Mediterranean . Greeks were active in other areas of the economy as well , such as owning coffee shops and other businesses in Constantinople . Following the Greek war of Independence however , Greeks were deemed to be untrustworthy by the Ottomans and their privileged economic status was eventually supplanted by that of the Armenians . Still , in the early part of the 20th century Greeks owned 45 % of the capital in the Ottoman Empire despite being a minority . Agricultural development however , remained stunted until the reforms that followed the Greek War of Independence . </P> <H2> Modern Greece ( edit ) </H2> <P> Modern Greece began its history as a nation state in 1829 and was largely an undeveloped economic area mostly based around agriculture . It has since developed into a modernised , developed nation . </P> <H3> 19th century ( edit ) </H3> <P> Greece entered its period of new - won independence in a somewhat different state than Serbia , which shared many of the post-independence economic problems such as land and land reform . In 1833 , the Greeks took control of a countryside devastated by war , depopulated in places and hampered by primitive agriculture and marginal soils . Just as in Serbia , which secured its autonomy from the Ottoman Empire at around the same time , communications were bad , presenting obstacles for any wider foreign commerce . Even by the late 19th century agricultural development had not advanced as significantly as had been intended as William Moffet , the US Consul in Athens explained : </P> <P> `` agriculture is here in the most undeveloped condition . Even in the immediate neighborhood of Athens it is common to find the wooden plow and the rude mattock which were in use 2,000 years ago . Fields are plowed up or scratched over , and crops replanted season after season , until the exhausted soil will bear no more . Fertilizers are not used to any appreciable extent , and the farm implements are of the very rudest description . Irrigation is in use in some districts , and , as far as I can ascertain , the methods in use can be readily learned by a study of the practices of the ancient Egyptians . Greece has olives and grapes in abundance , and of quality not excelled ; but Greek olive oil and Greek wine will not bear transportation . '' </P> <P> Greece had a substantial wealthy commercial class of rural notables and island shipowners , and access to 9,000,000 acres ( 36,000 km ) of land expropriated from Muslim owners who had been driven off during the War of Independence . </P> Land reform ( edit ) <P> Land reform represented the first real test for the new Greek kingdom . The new Greek government deliberately adopted land reforms intended to create of class of free peasants . The `` Law for the Dotation of Greek Families '' of 1835 extended 2,000 drachmas credit to every family , to be used to buy a 12 - acre ( 49,000 m ) farm at auction under a low - cost loan plan . The country was full of displaced refugees and empty Turkish estates . By a series of land reforms over several decades , the government distributed this confiscated land among veterans and the poor , so that by 1870 most Greek peasant families owned about 20 acres ( 81,000 m ) . These farms were too small for prosperity but the land reform signaled the goal of a society in which Greeks were equals and could support themselves , instead of working for hire on the estates of the rich . The class basis of rivalry between Greek factions was thereby reduced . </P> <H3> 20th century ( edit ) </H3> Industry ( edit ) <P> During the 19th century slowly developing industrial activity ( including heavy industry like shipbuilding ) was mainly concentrated in Ermoupolis and Piraeus . </P> <P> The series of wars between 1912 and 1922 provided a catalyst for Greek industry , with a number of industries such as textiles ; ammunition and boot - making springing up to supply the military . After the wars most of these industries were converted to civilian uses . Greek refugees from Asia Minor , the most famous of which is Aristotle Onassis who hailed from Smyrna ( modern Izmir ) also had a tremendous impact on the evolution of Greek industry and banking . Greeks held 45 % of the capital in the Ottoman Empire before 1914 , and many of the refugees expelled from Turkey had funds and skills which they quickly put to use in Greece . </P> <P> These refugees from Asia Minor also led to rapid growth of urban areas in Greece , as the vast majority of them settled in urban centers such as Athens and Thessaloniki . The 1920 census reported that 36.3 % of Greeks lived in urban or semi-urban areas , while the 1928 census reported that 45.6 % of Greeks lived in urban or semi-urban areas . It has been argued by many Greek economists that these refugees kept Greek industry competitive during the 1920s , as the surplus of labor kept real wages very low . Although this thesis makes economic sense , it is sheer speculation as there is no reliable data on wages and prices in Greece during this period . </P> <P> Greek industry went into decline slightly before the country joined the EC , and this trend continued . Although worker productivity rose significantly in Greece , labor costs increased too fast for the Greek manufacturing industry to remain competitive in Europe . There was also very little modernization in Greek industries due to a lack of financing . </P> Dichotomization of the drachma ( edit ) <P> Budgetary problems caused the Greek government to dichotomization of the drachma . Unable to secure any more loans from abroad to finance the war with Turkey , in 1922 Finance Minister Petros Protopapadakis declared that each drachma was essentially to be cut in half . Half of the value of the drachma would be kept by the owner , and the other half would be surrendered by the government in exchange for a 20 - year 6.5 % loan . World War II led to these loans not being repaid , but even if the war had not occurred it is doubtful that the Greek government would have been able to repay such enormous debts to its own populace . This strategy led to large revenues for the Greek state , and inflation effects were minimal . This strategy was repeated in 1926 due to the government 's inability to pay back loans incurred from the decade of war and the resettlement of the refugees . Deflation occurred after this dichotomization of the drachma , as well as a rise in interest rates . These policies had the effect of causing much of the populace to lose faith in their government , and investment decreased as people began to stop holding their assets in cash which had become unstable , and began holding real goods . </P> Great Depression ( edit ) <P> As the reverberations of the Great Depression hit Greece in 1932 , the Bank of Greece tried to adopt deflationary policies to stave off the crises that were going on in other countries , but these largely failed . For a brief period the drachma was pegged to the US dollar , but this was unsustainable given the country 's large trade deficit and the only long - term effects of this were Greece 's foreign exchange reserves being almost totally wiped out in 1932 . Remittances from abroad declined sharply and the value of the drachma began to plummet from 77 drachmas to the dollar in March 1931 to 111 drachmas to the dollar in April , 1931 . This was especially harmful to Greece as the country relied on imports from the UK , France and the Middle East for many necessities . Greece went off the gold standard in April , 1932 and declared a moratorium on all interest payments . The country also adopted protectionist policies such as import quotas , which a number of European countries did during the time period . </P> <P> Protectionist policies coupled with a weak drachma , stifling imports , allowed Greek industry to expand during the Great Depression . In 1939 Greek Industrial output was 179 % that of 1928 . These industries were for the most part `` built on sand '' as one report of the Bank of Greece put it , as without massive protection they would not have been able to survive . Despite the global depression , Greece managed to suffer comparatively little , averaging an average growth rate of 3.5 % from 1932 - 1939 . The dictatorial regime of Ioannis Metaxas took over the Greek government in 1936 , and economic growth was strong in the years leading up to the Second World War . </P> Shipping ( edit ) Further information : Greek shipping <P> The one industry in which Greece had major success was the shipping industry . Greece 's geography has made the country a major player in maritime affairs from antiquity , and Greece has a strong modern tradition dating from the Treaty of K\u00fc\u00e7\u00fck Kaynarca in 1774 which allowed Greek ships to escape Ottoman domination by registering under the Russian flag . The treaty prompted a number of Greek commercial houses to be set up across the Mediterranean and the Black Sea , and after independence , Greece 's shipping industry was one of the few bright spots in the modern Greek economy during the 19th century . After both world wars the Greek shipping industry was hit hard by the decline in world trade , but both times it revived quickly . The Greek government aided the revival of the Greek shipping industry with insurance promises following the Second World War . Tycoons such as Aristotle Onassis also aided in strengthening the Greek merchant fleet , and shipping has remained one of the few sectors in which Greece still excels . Today , the Greek merchant marine comes third globally both in the number of ships owned and in tonnage , and at times in the 90s Greece was first . Greece is fifth in terms of registration , the reason for this is a number of Greek captains register their ships under the Cypriot flag , which is easy due to linguistic and cultural commonalities , and significantly where there are lower taxes . In terms of registration , Cyprus has the third largest merchant fleet , and the majority of these ships are actually owned by Greeks , but sailing under the Cypriot flag for tax purposes . </P> Tourism ( edit ) Further information : Tourism in Greece <P> It was during the 60s and 70s that tourism , which now accounts for 15 % of Greece 's GDP , began to become a major earner of foreign exchange . This was initially opposed by many in the Greek government , as it was seen as a very unstable source of income in the event of any political shocks . It was also opposed by many conservatives and by the Church as bad for the country 's morals . Despite concerns , tourism grew significantly in Greece and was encouraged by successive governments as it was a very easy source of badly needed foreign exchange revenues . </P> Agriculture ( edit ) Further information : Agriculture in Greece <P> The resolution of the Greco - Turkish War and the Treaty of Lausanne led to a population exchange between Greece and Turkey , which also had massive ramifications on the agricultural sector in Greece . The tsifliks were abolished , and Greek refugees from Asia Minor settled on these abandoned and partitioned estates . In 1920 only 4 % of land holdings were of sizes more than 24 acres ( 97,000 m ) , and only . 3 % of these were in large estates of more than 123 acres ( 0.50 km ) . This pattern of small scale farm ownership has continued to the present day , with the small number of larger farms declining slightly . </P> <P> Greece differed greatly from any other country in the EC at the time of its admission as agriculture , although in decline , was a much larger sector of the economy than in any other EC member . In 1981 Greek agriculture made up 17 % of GDP and 30 % of employment , in comparison to 5 % of GDP and less than 10 % of employment in EU countries excluding Ireland and Italy . Greece managed to implement the reforms according to the Common Agricultural Policy ( CAP ) ahead of schedule , with prices generally rising to meet those in the rest of the EC . Previously Greece had heavily subsidized agriculture , and moving to the CAP meant that Greece moved from subsidies to price supports , so the consumer rather than the taxpayer would bear the burden of supporting farmers . Due to the CAP being formulated with other countries in mind , CAP subsidies had the effect of moving production away from products in which Greece had a comparative advantage , which hurt the country 's trade balance . While farm incomes rose slightly after Greece 's entry into the EC , this has not stopped the general trend of an ever decreasing agricultural sector which is in line with other European countries . </P> Post-world War II ( edit ) Further information : Greek economic miracle <P> Greece suffered comparatively much more than most Western European countries during the Second World War due to a number of factors . Heavy resistance led to immense German reprisals against civilians . Greece was also dependent on food imports , and a British naval blockade coupled with transfers of agricultural produce to Germany led to famine . It is estimated that the Greek population declined by 7 % during the Second World War . Greece experienced hyperinflation during the war . In 1943 , prices were 34,864 % higher compared to those of 1940 ; in 1944 , prices were 163,910,000,000 % higher compared to the 1940 prices . The Greek hyperinflation is the fifth worst in economic history , after Hungary 's following World War II , Zimbabwe 's in the late 2000s , Yugoslavia 's in the middle 1990s , and Germany 's following World War I . This was compounded by the country 's disastrous civil war from 1944 - 1950 . </P> <P> Greek economy was in an extremely poor state in 1950 ( after the end of the Civil War ) , with its relative position dramatically affected . In that year Greece had a per capita GDP of $1,951 , which was well below that of countries like Portugal ( $2,132 ) , Poland ( $2,480 ) , and even Mexico ( $2,085 ) . Greece 's per capita GDP was comparable to that of countries like Bulgaria ( $1,651 ) , Japan ( $1,873 ) , or Morocco ( $1,611 ) . Greece 's per - capita GDP grew quickly . Greece 's growth averaged 7 % between 1950 and 1973 , a rate second only to Japan 's during the same period . In 1950 Greece was ranked 28th in the world for per capita GDP , while in 1970 it was ranked 20th . </P> <H3> Late 20th century ( edit ) </H3> <P> During the 80s , despite membership in the EC , Greece suffered from poor macroeconomic performance due to expansionary fiscal policies that led to a tripling of the debt - to - GDP ratio , which went from the modest figure of 34.5 % in 1981 to the triple digits by the 90s . The second oil shock after the Iranian Revolution hurt Greece , and the 80s were racked by high inflation as politicians pursued populist policies . The average rate of inflation in Greece during the 80s was 19 % , which was three times the EU average . The Greek budget deficit also rose very substantially during the 80s , peaking at 9 % in 1985 . In the late 80s Greece implemented stabilization programs , cutting inflation from 25 % in 1985 to 16 % in 1987 . The debt accumulated in the 80s was a large problem for the Greek government , and by 1991 interest payments on the public debt reached almost 12 % of GDP . When the Maastricht Treaty was signed in 1991 , Greece was very far from meeting the convergence criteria . For example , the inflation rate of Greece was 19.8 % , while the EU average was 4.07 % and the government 's deficit was 11.5 % of GDP , while the EU average was 3.64 % . Nonetheless , Greece was able to dramatically improve its finances during the 1990s , with both inflation and budget deficit falling below 3 % by 1999 , and the government concealed economic problems . Thus , it met the criteria for entry into Eurozone ( including the budget deficit criterion even after its recent revision calculated with the method in force at the time ) . </P> <H3> Debt crisis of 2010 ( edit ) </H3> Main article : Greek government - debt crisis <P> Greece entered a prolonged recession in 2008 and by April 2010 the government realized that it would need a rescue package . Greece had the biggest sovereign debt default in history . In April 2014 , Greece returned to the global bond market as it successfully sold \u20ac 3 billion worth of five - year government bonds at a yield of 4.95 % . Greece had real GDP growth of 0.7 % in 2014 after 5 years of decline . </P> <H2> See also ( edit ) </H2> <Ul> <Li> Economy of Europe </Li> <Li> Greek phoenix </Li> </Ul> <H2> References ( edit ) </H2> <Ol> <Li> Jump up ^ `` CH 1 - The Dawn of the Bronze Age. doc '' ( PDF ) .

The Minoans were also innovators , <wd_idx<810>> developing ( or adopting ) a system of lead weights <wd_idx<820>> to facilitate economic transactions . Despite this Minoan civilization remained <wd_idx<830>> , for the most part , an agriculturally driven one <wd_idx<840>> . </P> <P> pigs and artists were an important part", "<wd_idx<820>> to facilitate economic transactions . Despite this Minoan civilization remained <wd_idx<830>> , for the most part , an agriculturally driven one <wd_idx<840>> . </P> <P> pigs and artists were an important part <wd_idx<850>> of the Minoan economy as they produced many goods that <wd_idx<860>> were valued in trade as well as within Crete itself <wd_idx<870>> . The Linear B tablets often refer to men or <wd_idx<880>> to their work , although , there were also female <wd_idx<890>> artisans , who mainly worked in the textile industry . <wd_idx<900>> We also know from archaeological evidence that Minoan artisans practised <wd_idx<910>> a large range of craftsmanship jobs including : scribes , <wd_idx<920>> potters , metalworkers , leather workers , glass and faience <wd_idx<930>> artists , painters , sculptors , engravers and jewelers . <wd_idx<940>> Due to only a small amount of evidence about occupation <wd_idx<950>> , we do not know whether a worker might have <wd_idx<960>> mastered in several trades , or fully specialized in one <wd_idx<970", "<wd_idx<940>> Due to only a small amount of evidence about occupation <wd_idx<950>> , we do not know whether a worker might have <wd_idx<960>> mastered in several trades , or fully specialized in one <wd_idx<970>> profession . There was an area set aside for artisans <wd_idx<980>> and their workshops in every palace , and in town <wd_idx<990>> like Malia , they had both workshops in town and <wd_idx<1000>> in the palace . </P> <P> The production of oil <wd_idx<1010>> was an important activity in which Minoan artisans were engaged <wd_idx<1020>> . There were a large number of oil jars found <wd_idx<1030>> in the destroyed palaces that tell us of the importance <wd_idx<1040>> of this industry . Oil was an extremely important part <wd_idx<1050>> of the perfume industry as it was used to clean <wd_idx<1060>> dirt from the body , much like soap does today <wd_idx<1070>> . Perfumes were also sprinkled on clothing , for aesthetic <wd_idx<1080>> reasons . It is certain that perfumes were a luxury <wd_idx<1090>> item of Minoan trade . </P> <P>", "<wd_idx<1070>> . Perfumes were also sprinkled on clothing , for aesthetic <wd_idx<1080>> reasons . It is certain that perfumes were a luxury <wd_idx<1090>> item of Minoan trade . </P> <P> The bronze industries <wd_idx<1100>> were also an important aspect of the Minoan economy and <wd_idx<1110>> the art of bronze making was very common , suggested <wd_idx<1120>> by the fact that evidence of bronze making was discovered <wd_idx<1130>> in many towns , such as Phaistos and Zakro , <wd_idx<1140>> but also as evidence in the area of Malia show <wd_idx<1150>> that bronze making operations were flourishing in many of the <wd_idx<1160>> palaces . It is believed that the Minoans imported tin <wd_idx<1170>> and copper to make bronze ingots for other people . <wd_idx<1180>> Evidence of this is shown in Egyptian tomb paintings where <wd_idx<1190>> the Keftyw ( people believed to be the Minoans ) <wd_idx<1200>> bring said ingots to the Egyptian king in gift exchange <wd_idx<1210>> ( The Egyptians and Minoans had a history", "<wd_idx<1190>> the Keftyw ( people believed to be the Minoans ) <wd_idx<1200>> bring said ingots to the Egyptian king in gift exchange <wd_idx<1210>> ( The Egyptians and Minoans had a history of cultural <wd_idx<1220>> exchange ) . Other objects made from bronze have been <wd_idx<1230>> found in numbers at Knossos , these include bronze mirrors <wd_idx<1240>> , labrys , votive figures , knives , cleavers and <wd_idx<1250>> small bronze tools . </P> <P> The stone carving industry <wd_idx<1260>> produced many vases and lamps , examples of which have <wd_idx<1270>> been found at palaces and palatial villas throughout Minoan Crete <wd_idx<1280>> . Another industry that contributed to the Minoan economy was <wd_idx<1290>> the wine industry , which is mentioned in Linear A <wd_idx<1300>> , but the small amounts referred to suggest it was <wd_idx<1310>> a commodity reserved for the wealthier class . </P> <H3> <wd_idx<1320>> Mycenaean civilization ( edit ) </H3> <P> The Mycenaean civilization <wd_idx", "<wd_idx<1310>> a commodity reserved for the wealthier class . </P> <H3> <wd_idx<1320>> Mycenaean civilization ( edit ) </H3> <P> The Mycenaean civilization <wd_idx<1330>> emerged during the late Bronze Age , supplanting the Minoans <wd_idx<1340>> as the dominant economic force in the area . The <wd_idx<1350>> Mycenaean economy itself was based on agriculture . The tablets <wd_idx<1360>> from both Pylos and Knossos demonstrate that there were two <wd_idx<1370>> major food - grains produced ; wheat and barley . <wd_idx<1380>> </P> <P> Agriculture was highly organised and this becomes apparent <wd_idx<1390>> by the written records of deliveries of land produce , <wd_idx<1400>> taxes in kind due to the palace , a hare <wd_idx<1410>> set aside for the gods and so forth . The <wd_idx<1420>> land used for agriculture was basically of two types , <wd_idx<1430>> represented by the terms ko - to - na ( <wd_idx<1440>> ktoina ) ki - ti - me - na and <wd", "<wd_idx<1420>> land used for agriculture was basically of two types , <wd_idx<1430>> represented by the terms ko - to - na ( <wd_idx<1440>> ktoina ) ki - ti - me - na and <wd_idx<1450>> ko - to - na ke - ke - me <wd_idx<1460>> - na . The former refers to the privately owned <wd_idx<1470>> land , the latter to the public one ( owned <wd_idx<1480>> by the damos ) . Cereals were used as the <wd_idx<1490>> basis of the rations ' system both at Knossos and <wd_idx<1500>> Pylos . At Knossos , for example , the rations <wd_idx<1510>> are quoted for a work - group composed of 18 <wd_idx<1520>> men and 8 boys as 97.5 units of barley . <wd_idx<1530>> </P> <P> Apart from cereals , the Mycenaeans also produced <wd_idx<1540>> wine , olive oil , oil from various spices and <wd_idx<1550>> figs . As far as wine is concerned , it <wd_idx<1560>> does not figure in the ordinary ration lists and may <wd_", "<wd_idx<1540>> wine , olive oil , oil from various spices and <wd_idx<1550>> figs . As far as wine is concerned , it <wd_idx<1560>> does not figure in the ordinary ration lists and may <wd_idx<1570>> have been something of a luxury or possibly for export <wd_idx<1580>> . Mycenaean trade was very advanced and there is even <wd_idx<1590>> evidence of an amber trade from Britain </P> <P> Metals <wd_idx<1600>> were also a very important part of the Mycenaean economy <wd_idx<1610>> , during the Mycenaean period there were five metals in <wd_idx<1620>> use : gold , silver , copper , tin and <wd_idx<1630>> lead . Iron was not unknown but was very rare <wd_idx<1640>> . Therefore , bronze was the main metal for the <wd_idx<1650>> making of tools and weapons . Although bronze was the <wd_idx<1660>> most important metal for the Mycenaeans , it was relatively <wd_idx<1670>> scarce and expensive . Our knowledge of the Mycenaean bronze <wd_idx<1680>> industry comes entirely from Pyl", "<wd_idx<1660>> most important metal for the Mycenaeans , it was relatively <wd_idx<1670>> scarce and expensive . Our knowledge of the Mycenaean bronze <wd_idx<1680>> industry comes entirely from Pylos where we have some information <wd_idx<1690>> about smiths . Most of the tablets concerning bronze demonstrate <wd_idx<1700>> a very tight control of the metal industry by the <wd_idx<1710>> palace . </P> <H2> Ancient Greece and the emergence of <wd_idx<1720>> the ' Polis ' ( edit ) </H2> Further information <wd_idx<1730>> : Economy of Ancient Greece <H3> Greece 's `` Dark <wd_idx<1740>> Ages '' ( edit ) </H3> <P> The Greek Dark <wd_idx<1750>> Ages were a period of economic stagnation for the Greeks <wd_idx<1760>> after the destruction of the complex Mycenaean economic system , <wd_idx<1770>> the loss of the widespread written script Linear B meant <wd_idx<1780>> that development was effectively stunted and living standards deteriorated . <wd_idx<1790>> Basic trading patterns remained however . </P> <H3>", "<wd_idx<1770>> the loss of the widespread written script Linear B meant <wd_idx<1780>> that development was effectively stunted and living standards deteriorated . <wd_idx<1790>> Basic trading patterns remained however . </P> <H3> City states <wd_idx<1800>> ( edit ) </H3> <P> The emergence of the ' <wd_idx<1810>> Polis ' as the model for ideal governance following the <wd_idx<1820>> end of the Greek Dark Ages heavily influenced the economy <wd_idx<1830>> of the Greeks at the time . This period , <wd_idx<1840>> of the 8th century BCE to the 4th century BCE <wd_idx<1850>> is conventionally termed as ' Ancient Greece ' .

They facilitated an <wd_idx<1980>> efficient trading system with other Greek city states .

These <wd_idx<4780>> policies had the effect of causing much of the populace <wd_idx<4790>> to lose faith in their government , and investment decreased <wd_idx<4800>> as people began to stop holding their assets in cash <wd_idx<4810>> which had become unstable , and began holding real goods <wd_idx<4820>> . </P> Great Depression ( edit ) <P> As the <wd_idx<4830>> reverberations of the Great Depression hit Greece in 1932 , <wd_idx<4840>> the Bank of Greece tried to adopt deflationary policies to <wd_idx<4850>> stave off the crises that were going on in other ", "<wd_idx<4830>> reverberations of the Great Depression hit Greece in 1932 , <wd_idx<4840>> the Bank of Greece tried to adopt deflationary policies to <wd_idx<4850>> stave off the crises that were going on in other <wd_idx<4860>> countries , but these largely failed . For a brief <wd_idx<4870>> period the drachma was pegged to the US dollar , <wd_idx<4880>> but this was unsustainable given the country 's large trade <wd_idx<4890>> deficit and the only long - term effects of this <wd_idx<4900>> were Greece 's foreign exchange reserves being almost totally wiped <wd_idx<4910>> out in 1932 . Remittances from abroad declined sharply and <wd_idx<4920>> the value of the drachma began to plummet from 77 <wd_idx<4930>> drachmas to the dollar in March 1931 to 111 drachmas <wd_idx<4940>> to the dollar in April , 1931 . This was <wd_idx<4950>> especially harmful to Greece as the country relied on imports <wd_idx<4960>> from the UK , France and the Middle East for <wd_idx<4970>> many necessities . Greece went off the gold standard in <wd_id", "<wd_idx<4950>> especially harmful to Greece as the country relied on imports <wd_idx<4960>> from the UK , France and the Middle East for <wd_idx<4970>> many necessities . Greece went off the gold standard in <wd_idx<4980>> April , 1932 and declared a moratorium on all interest <wd_idx<4990>> payments . The country also adopted protectionist policies such as <wd_idx<5000>> import quotas , which a number of European countries did <wd_idx<5010>> during the time period . </P> <P> Protectionist policies coupled <wd_idx<5020>> with a weak drachma , stifling imports , allowed Greek <wd_idx<5030>> industry to expand during the Great Depression . In 1939 <wd_idx<5040>> Greek Industrial output was 179 % that of 1928 . <wd_idx<5050>> These industries were for the most part `` built on <wd_idx<5060>> sand '' as one report of the Bank of Greece <wd_idx<5070>> put it , as without massive protection they would not <wd_idx<5080>> have been able to survive . Despite the global depression <wd_idx<5090>> , Greece managed to suffer comparatively little , averaging an <wd_idx<5100>> average growth rate of 3.5 % from 1932 - 1939 <wd", "<wd_idx<5080>> have been able to survive . Despite the global depression <wd_idx<5090>> , Greece managed to suffer comparatively little , averaging an <wd_idx<5100>> average growth rate of 3.5 % from 1932 - 1939 <wd_idx<5110>> . The dictatorial regime of Ioannis Metaxas took over the <wd_idx<5120>> Greek government in 1936 , and economic growth was strong <wd_idx<5130>> in the years leading up to the Second World War <wd_idx<5140>> . </P> Shipping ( edit ) Further information : Greek <wd_idx<5150>> shipping <P> The one industry in which Greece had major <wd_idx<5160>> success was the shipping industry . Greece 's geography has <wd_idx<5170>> made the country a major player in maritime affairs from <wd_idx<5180>> antiquity , and Greece has a strong modern tradition dating <wd_idx<5190>> from the Treaty of K\u00fc\u00e7\u00fck Kaynarca in 1774 which allowed <wd_idx<5200>> Greek ships to escape Ottoman domination by registering under the <wd_idx<5210>> Russian flag . The treaty prompted a number of Greek <wd_idx<5220>> commercial houses to be set up across the Mediterranean and <wd_id", "<wd_idx<5200>> Greek ships to escape Ottoman domination by registering under the <wd_idx<5210>> Russian flag . The treaty prompted a number of Greek <wd_idx<5220>> commercial houses to be set up across the Mediterranean and <wd_idx<5230>> the Black Sea , and after independence , Greece 's <wd_idx<5240>> shipping industry was one of the few bright spots in <wd_idx<5250>> the modern Greek economy during the 19th century . After <wd_idx<5260>> both world wars the Greek shipping industry was hit hard <wd_idx<5270>> by the decline in world trade , but both times <wd_idx<5280>> it revived quickly . The Greek government aided the revival <wd_idx<5290>> of the Greek shipping industry with insurance promises following the <wd_idx<5300>> Second World War . Tycoons such as Aristotle Onassis also <wd_idx<5310>> aided in strengthening the Greek merchant fleet , and shipping <wd_idx<5320>> has remained one of the few sectors in which Greece <wd_idx<5330>> still excels . Today , the Greek merchant marine comes <wd_idx<5340>> third globally both in the number of ships owned and <wd_idx<5350>> in tonnage , and at times in the 90s Greece", "<wd_idx<5330>> still excels . Today , the Greek merchant marine comes <wd_idx<5340>> third globally both in the number of ships owned and <wd_idx<5350>> in tonnage , and at times in the 90s Greece <wd_idx<5360>> was first . Greece is fifth in terms of registration <wd_idx<5370>> , the reason for this is a number of Greek <wd_idx<5380>> captains register their ships under the Cypriot flag , which <wd_idx<5390>> is easy due to linguistic and cultural commonalities , and <wd_idx<5400>> significantly where there are lower taxes . In terms of <wd_idx<5410>> registration , Cyprus has the third largest merchant fleet , <wd_idx<5420>> and the majority of these ships are actually owned by <wd_idx<5430>> Greeks , but sailing under the Cypriot flag for tax <wd_idx<5440>> purposes . </P> Tourism ( edit ) Further information : <wd_idx<5450>> Tourism in Greece <P> It was during the 60s and <wd_idx<5460>> 70s that tourism , which now accounts for 15 % <wd_idx<5470>> of Greece 's GDP , began to become a major <wd_idx<5480>> earner of foreign exchange . This was initially opposed by ", "<wd_idx<5460>> 70s that tourism , which now accounts for 15 % <wd_idx<5470>> of Greece 's GDP , began to become a major <wd_idx<5480>> earner of foreign exchange . This was initially opposed by <wd_idx<5490>> many in the Greek government , as it was seen <wd_idx<5500>> as a very unstable source of income in the event <wd_idx<5510>> of any political shocks . It was also opposed by <wd_idx<5520>> many conservatives and by the Church as bad for the <wd_idx<5530>> country 's morals . Despite concerns , tourism grew significantly <wd_idx<5540>> in Greece and was encouraged by successive governments as it <wd_idx<5550>> was a very easy source of badly needed foreign exchange <wd_idx<5560>> revenues . </P> Agriculture ( edit ) Further information : <wd_idx<5570>> Agriculture in Greece <P> The resolution of the Greco - <wd_idx<5580>> Turkish War and the Treaty of Lausanne led to a <wd_idx<5590>> population exchange between Greece and Turkey , which also had <wd_idx<5600>> massive ramifications on the agricultural sector in Greece . The <wd_idx<5610>> tsifliks were abolished , and Greek refugees from Asia Minor ", "<wd_idx<5590>> population exchange between Greece and Turkey , which also had <wd_idx<5600>> massive ramifications on the agricultural sector in Greece . The <wd_idx<5610>> tsifliks were abolished , and Greek refugees from Asia Minor <wd_idx<5620>> settled on these abandoned and partitioned estates . In 1920 <wd_idx<5630>> only 4 % of land holdings were of sizes more <wd_idx<5640>> than 24 acres ( 97,000 m ) , and only <wd_idx<5650>> . 3 % of these were in large estates of <wd_idx<5660>> more than 123 acres ( 0.50 km ) . This <wd_idx<5670>> pattern of small scale farm ownership has continued to the <wd_idx<5680>> present day , with the small number of larger farms <wd_idx<5690>> declining slightly . </P> <P> Greece differed greatly from any <wd_idx<5700>> other country in the EC at the time of its <wd_idx<5710>> admission as agriculture , although in decline , was a <wd_idx<5720>> much larger sector of the economy than in any other <wd_idx<5730>> EC member . In 1981 Greek agriculture made up 17 <wd_id", "<wd_idx<5710>> admission as agriculture , although in decline , was a <wd_idx<5720>> much larger sector of the economy than in any other <wd_idx<5730>> EC member . In 1981 Greek agriculture made up 17 <wd_idx<5740>> % of GDP and 30 % of employment , in <wd_idx<5750>> comparison to 5 % of GDP and less than 10 <wd_idx<5760>> % of employment in EU countries excluding Ireland and Italy <wd_idx<5770>> . Greece managed to implement the reforms according to the <wd_idx<5780>> Common Agricultural Policy ( CAP ) ahead of schedule , <wd_idx<5790>> with prices generally rising to meet those in the rest <wd_idx<5800>> of the EC . Previously Greece had heavily subsidized agriculture <wd_idx<5810>> , and moving to the CAP meant that Greece moved <wd_idx<5820>> from subsidies to price supports , so the consumer rather <wd_idx<5830>> than the taxpayer would bear the burden of supporting farmers <wd_idx<5840>> . Due to the CAP being formulated with other countries <wd_idx<5850>> in mind , CAP subsidies had the effect of moving <wd_idx<5860>> production away from products in which Greece had a comparative <wd_id", "<wd_idx<5840>> . Due to the CAP being formulated with other countries <wd_idx<5850>> in mind , CAP subsidies had the effect of moving <wd_idx<5860>> production away from products in which Greece had a comparative <wd_idx<5870>> advantage , which hurt the country 's trade balance . <wd_idx<5880>> While farm incomes rose slightly after Greece 's entry into <wd_idx<5890>> the EC , this has not stopped the general trend <wd_idx<5900>> of an ever decreasing agricultural sector which is in line <wd_idx<5910>> with other European countries . </P> Post-world War II ( <wd_idx<5920>> edit ) Further information : Greek economic miracle <P> Greece <wd_idx<5930>> suffered comparatively much more than most Western European countries during <wd_idx<5940>> the Second World War due to a number of factors <wd_idx<5950>> . Heavy resistance led to immense German reprisals against civilians <wd_idx<5960>> . Greece was also dependent on food imports , and <wd_idx<5970>> a British naval blockade coupled with transfers of agricultural produce <wd_idx<5980>> to Germany led to famine . It is estimated that <wd_idx<5990>> the Greek population declined by 7 % during the Second <wd_id", "<wd_idx<5970>> a British naval blockade coupled with transfers of agricultural produce <wd_idx<5980>> to Germany led to famine . It is estimated that <wd_idx<5990>> the Greek population declined by 7 % during the Second <wd_idx<6000>> World War . Greece experienced hyperinflation during the war . <wd_idx<6010>> In 1943 , prices were 34,864 % higher compared to <wd_idx<6020>> those of 1940 ; in 1944 , prices were 163,910,000,000 <wd_idx<6030>> % higher compared to the 1940 prices . The Greek <wd_idx<6040>> hyperinflation is the fifth worst in economic history , after <wd_idx<6050>> Hungary 's following World War II , Zimbabwe 's in <wd_idx<6060>> the late 2000s , Yugoslavia 's in the middle 1990s <wd_idx<6070>> , and Germany 's following World War I . This <wd_idx<6080>> was compounded by the country 's disastrous civil war from <wd_idx<6090>> 1944 - 1950 . </P> <P> Greek economy was in <wd_idx<6100>> an extremely poor state in 1950 ( after the end <wd_idx<6110>> of the Civil War ) , with its relative position", "<wd_idx<6090>> 1944 - 1950 . </P> <P> Greek economy was in <wd_idx<6100>> an extremely poor state in 1950 ( after the end <wd_idx<6110>> of the Civil War ) , with its relative position <wd_idx<6120>> dramatically affected . In that year Greece had a per <wd_idx<6130>> capita GDP of $1,951 , which was well below that <wd_idx<6140>> of countries like Portugal ( $2,132 ) , Poland ( <wd_idx<6150>> $2,480 ) , and even Mexico ( $2,085 ) . <wd_idx<6160>> Greece 's per capita GDP was comparable to that of <wd_idx<6170>> countries like Bulgaria ( $1,651 ) , Japan ( $1,873 <wd_idx<6180>> ) , or Morocco ( $1,611 ) . Greece 's <wd_idx<6190>> per - capita GDP grew quickly . Greece 's growth <wd_idx<6200>> averaged 7 % between 1950 and 1973 , a rate <wd_idx<6210>> second only to Japan 's during the same period . <wd_idx<6220>> In 1950 Greece was ranked 28th in the world for <wd", "<wd_idx<6200>> averaged 7 % between 1950 and 1973 , a rate <wd_idx<6210>> second only to Japan 's during the same period . <wd_idx<6220>> In 1950 Greece was ranked 28th in the world for <wd_idx<6230>> per capita GDP , while in 1970 it was ranked <wd_idx<6240>> 20th . </P> <H3> Late 20th century ( edit ) <wd_idx<6250>> </H3> <P> During the 80s , despite membership in the <wd_idx<6260>> EC , Greece suffered from poor macroeconomic performance due to <wd_idx<6270>> expansionary fiscal policies that led to a tripling of the <wd_idx<6280>> debt - to - GDP ratio , which went from <wd_idx<6290>> the modest figure of 34.5 % in 1981 to the <wd_idx<6300>> triple digits by the 90s . The second oil shock <wd_idx<6310>> after the Iranian Revolution hurt Greece , and the 80s <wd_idx<6320>> were racked by high inflation as politicians pursued populist policies <wd_idx<6330>> . The average rate of inflation in Greece during the <wd_idx<6340>> 80s was 19 % , which was three times the <wd_", "<wd_idx<6320>> were racked by high inflation as politicians pursued populist policies <wd_idx<6330>> . The average rate of inflation in Greece during the <wd_idx<6340>> 80s was 19 % , which was three times the <wd_idx<6350>> EU average . The Greek budget deficit also rose very <wd_idx<6360>> substantially during the 80s , peaking at 9 % in <wd_idx<6370>> 1985 . In the late 80s Greece implemented stabilization programs <wd_idx<6380>> , cutting inflation from 25 % in 1985 to 16 <wd_idx<6390>> % in 1987 . The debt accumulated in the 80s <wd_idx<6400>> was a large problem for the Greek government , and <wd_idx<6410>> by 1991 interest payments on the public debt reached almost <wd_idx<6420>> 12 % of GDP . When the Maastricht Treaty was <wd_idx<6430>> signed in 1991 , Greece was very far from meeting <wd_idx<6440>> the convergence criteria . For example , the inflation rate <wd_idx<6450>> of Greece was 19.8 % , while the EU average <wd_idx<6460>> was 4.07 % and the government 's deficit was 11.5 <wd_idx<6470>> % of GDP , while the EU", "<wd_idx<6450>> of Greece was 19.8 % , while the EU average <wd_idx<6460>> was 4.07 % and the government 's deficit was 11.5 <wd_idx<6470>> % of GDP , while the EU average was 3.64 <wd_idx<6480>> % . Nonetheless , Greece was able to dramatically improve <wd_idx<6490>> its finances during the 1990s , with both inflation and <wd_idx<6500>> budget deficit falling below 3 % by 1999 , and <wd_idx<6510>> the government concealed economic problems . Thus , it met <wd_idx<6520>> the criteria for entry into Eurozone ( including the budget <wd_idx<6530>> deficit criterion even after its recent revision calculated with the <wd_idx<6540>> method in force at the time ) . </P> <H3> <wd_idx<6550>> Debt crisis of 2010 ( edit ) </H3> Main article <wd_idx<6560>> : Greek government - debt crisis <P> Greece entered a <wd_idx<6570>> prolonged recession in 2008 and by April 2010 the government <wd_idx<6580>> realized that it would need a rescue package .

A duo of rednecks arrive and one begins sexually harassing Mallory while she is dancing . She briefly encourages him before beating him to a pulp , screaming `` How sexy am I now , huh flirty boy ? '' . Mickey and Mallory then murder all but one of the diner 's staff , and one customer , culminating in a morbid game of Eeny , meeny , miny , moe to decide who lives and dies . After killing the waitress Mabel , the couple ensures that the only survivor remembers their names so that he can pass on the legend of Mickey and Mallory before they embrace and declare their undying love . </P> <H3> Part I </H3> <P> Mickey and Mallory camp out in the desert , and Mallory reminisces about when they first met . A flashback ( done in the style of a TV sitcom , including a laughtrack ) shows Mickey as a meat deliveryman who came to the house where Mallory lived with her sexually abusive father , her neglectful mother , and her younger brother , Kevin . Mickey and Mallory fall in love instantly and leave together , stealing Mallory 's father 's car . Soon Mickey is arrested and imprisoned for auto theft , but he subsequently escapes from a prison work farm during a tornado and returns to Mallory 's house . The two kill Mallory 's parents , but spare Kevin . Mallory 's father is beaten and then drowned in the fish tank while her mother is tied to her bed and set on fire . Mickey and Mallory then go on the road together and get `` married '' on the side of a bridge , celebrating by taking a hostage . Furious with Mickey 's notion that they have a threesome , Mallory drives to a nearby gas station , where she flirts with the mechanic . They begin to have sex on the hood of a car , but Mallory kills him when he recognizes her as a wanted killer . During this time , Mickey rapes the hostage . </P> <H3> Part ii </H3> <P> The pair continue their killing spree , ultimately claiming fifty - two victims in New Mexico , Arizona , and Nevada . Pursuing them is Detective Jack Scagnetti , who became obsessed with mass murderers after witnessing his mother being shot and killed by Charles Whitman when he was eight . Beneath his heroic facade , he is a violent psychopath . The audience witnesses Scagnetti violently strangle a prostitute to death . The killers are also followed by self - serving tabloid journalist Wayne Gale . Gale profiles Mickey and Mallory on his show , American Maniacs , soon elevating them to cult hero status . </P> <P> Mickey and Mallory get lost in the desert after taking psychedelic mushrooms . They come across a ranch where they encounter Warren Red Cloud , a Navajo Indian , and his young grandson . The Navajo provides them with food and shelter . After the two fall asleep , the Navajo , hoping to expel the demon he perceives in Mickey , begins chanting beside the fire . This invokes nightmares in Mickey about his abusive parents . Mickey wakes up in a panicked rage and fatally shoots Red Cloud before he realizes what he is doing . Mallory wakes up to the sound of the gunshot and starts screaming at Mickey for killing the man who sheltered them . This is the first time Mallory and Mickey feel guilty for a murder . Fleeing from the scene , they step outside of the house and come across a field of rattlesnakes . Mallory does not see the snakes and gets bitten first . Mickey lights a stick on fire to expose the snakes . While he is trying to help Mallory he also gets bitten . </P> <P> They drive to a drugstore to find snakebite antidote , however the store is completely sold out . Mallory falls to the ground while Mickey runs to the pharmacy with the hopes that there will be more medication in stock . The pharmacist recognizes Mickey from the news report and sets off the silent alarm before Mickey kills him . Soon police cars arrive and Mallory is captured and subsequently beaten by the police . A gunfight breaks out between Mickey and the others while Mallory is held hostage . Scagnetti arrives and tells Mickey that unless he surrenders , he will cut off Mallory 's breasts . Mickey gives up his guns , but attacks Scagnetti with a knife . The police taser him and the scene ends with Mickey and Mallory being beaten by a group of vengeful policemen as a Japanese news crew fronted by a female reporter films the action . </P> <H3> Part iii </H3> <P> The story picks up one year later : the homicidal couple have been imprisoned , and are due to be moved to a mental hospital after being declared insane . Mickey and Mallory have now gone one year without seeing each other . Scagnetti arrives at the prison and encounters Warden Dwight McClusky , with whom he plans to murder the two criminals . McClusky will arrange for Scagnetti to be the driver for the Knoxes ' transfer . Alone with the pair , Scagnetti will murder them , then claim that they tried to escape . </P> <P> Meanwhile , Gale has persuaded Mickey to agree to a live interview that will air immediately after the Super Bowl . Mallory is held in solitary confinement elsewhere in the prison , awaiting her transport to the mental hospital . During the interview , Mickey gives a speech about how murder provides enlightenment and declares himself a `` natural born killer '' . His words inspire the other inmates ( who are watching the interview on TV in the recreation room ) and incite them to riot . </P> <P> McClusky , upon learning of the riot , orders the interview terminated despite Gale 's vehement protests . Mickey is left alone with Gale , the film crew and several guards . Using a lengthy joke as a diversion , Mickey overpowers a guard and grabs his shotgun . He kills most of the guards with it and takes the survivors hostage , leading them through the prison riot . Gale follows , giving a live television report as people are beaten and killed around him . </P> <P> While this riot is unfolding , Scagnetti enters Mallory 's cell and attempts to seduce her . Mallory , feigning to reciprocate at first , rebuffs his efforts , smashing his face against the wall and breaking his nose . The two guards outside the cell struggle to enter while Mallory attacks Scagnetti . Finally , the two guards subdue her , and Scagnetti sprays her face with tear gas in revenge . Still live on national television , Mickey arrives at Mallory 's cell , where he kills all the guards and engages in a Mexican standoff with Scagnetti , eventually feigning a concession . Mallory then approaches Scagnetti from behind and slashes his throat with a shank . To Scagnetti 's horror , Mickey tells him that he was out of shotgun shells during the standoff . Mallory then picks up Scagnetti 's gun , saying `` You still like me now , Jack ? '' and kills him . </P> <P> Mickey and Mallory continue to escape through the riot torn prison , with Gale 's entire TV crew getting killed . Gale himself snaps , succumbing to Stockholm syndrome as well as indulging in his own longtime fascination for murder , and begins to shoot at the guards with a pistol that he has taken from one of the dead guards , but gets so frenzied that Mickey prefers to disarm him . After being rescued by a mysterious prisoner named Owen Traft , the trio of Mickey , Mallory , and Gale run into McClusky and a heavily armed posse of guards . The trio takes cover in a blood - splattered shower room . McClusky threatens to storm the shower room ; Mickey , in turn , threatens to kill both Gale and a guard on live TV , and the prisoners walk out the front door , to McClusky 's utter dismay , as he helplessly threatens to hunt them down . McClusky and his guards are then quickly massacred by hordes of inmates . </P> <P> Mickey and Mallory steal a van and kill the last guard ; Owen 's fate is unknown . Escaping to a rural location , they give a final interview to Gale , whose ear they have seemingly removed ( implied , but as a camera track reveals ) , before they tell him he must die also . He attempts various arguments to change their minds , finally appealing to their trademark practice of leaving one survivor ; Mickey informs him they are leaving a witness to tell the tale , his camera . Gale accepts his fate and extends his arms as if on a cross as they shoot him dead while his unattended camera continues to roll . The couple is shown several years later , in an RV , with Mickey driving and a pregnant Mallory watching their two children play . </P> <H2> Cast </H2> Main article : List of Natural Born Killers characters <Ul> <Li> Woody Harrelson as Mickey Knox </Li> <Li> Juliette Lewis as Mallory Wilson Knox </Li> <Li> Robert Downey , Jr. as Wayne Gale </Li> <Li> Tom Sizemore as Detective Jack Scagnetti </Li> <Li> Tommy Lee Jones as Warden Dwight McClusky </Li> <Li> Rodney Dangerfield as Ed Wilson </Li> <Li> Edie McClurg as Mrs. Wilson </Li> <Li> Ross Malinger as Kevin Wilson </Li> <Li> Russell Means as Warren Red Cloud , Sr. aka The Navajo Man </Li> <Li> Lanny Flaherty as Earl </Li> <Li> Evan Handler as David </Li> <Li> Balthazar Getty as Gas station attendant </Li> <Li> Richard Lineback as Sonny </Li> <Li> Kirk Baltz as Roger </Li> <Li> Steven Wright as Dr. Emil Reingold </Li> <Li> Pruitt Taylor Vince as Deputy Warden Kavanaugh </Li> <Li> Joe Grifasi as Deputy Sheriff Duncan Homolka </Li> <Li> Everett Quinton as Deputy Wurlitzer </Li> <Li> Marshall Bell as Deputy </Li> <Li> Peter Crombie as Intense cop </Li> <Li> Grand L.

Tarantino had sold an option for his script to producers Jane Hamsher and Don Murphy for $10,000 after he had tried , and failed , to direct it himself for $500,000 . Hamsher and Murphy subsequently sold the screenplay to Warner Bros. Around the same time , Oliver Stone was made aware of the script . He was keen to find something more straightforward than his previous production , Heaven & Earth ; a difficult shoot which had left him exhausted , and he felt that Natural Born Killers could be what he was looking for . </P> <P> David Veloz , associate producer Richard Rutowski , and Stone rewrote the script , keeping much of the dialogue but changing the focus of the film from journalist Wayne Gale to Mickey and Mallory . The script was changed so much that as per WGA rules , Tarantino was credited for the film 's story only . In a 1993 interview , Tarantino stated that he did not hold any animosity towards Stone , and that he wished the film well ; </P> <P> `` It 's not going to be my movie , it 's going to be Oliver Stone 's , and God bless him . I hope he does a good job with it . If I was n't emotionally attached to it , I 'm sure I would find it very interesting . If you like my stuff , you might not like this movie . But if you like his stuff , you 're probably going to love it . It might be the best thing he 's ever done , but not because of anything to do with me . ( ... ) I actually ca n't wait to see it , to tell you the truth . '' </P> <P> Initially , when producers Hamsher and Murphy had first brought the script to Stone 's attention , he had seen it as an action film ; `` something Arnold Schwarzenegger would be proud of . '' As the project developed however , incidents such as the O.J. Simpson case , the Menendez brothers case , the Tonya Harding / Nancy Kerrigan incident , the Rodney King incident , and the Federal assault of the Branch Davidian sect all took place . Stone came to feel that the media was heavily involved in the outcome of all of these cases , and that the media had become an all - pervasive entity which marketed violence and suffering for the good of ratings . As such , he changed the tone of the movie from one of simple action to a satirical critique of the media in general . Also coloring Stone 's approach , and contributing to the violent nature of the film , were the anger and sadness he felt at the breakdown of his second marriage . He also said in an interview that the film was influenced by the `` vitality '' of Indian cinema . He let Rodney Dangerfield write or rewrite all of his own character 's lines . </P> <P> During pre-production , to prepare for the role of Wayne Gale , Downey spent time with Australian TV shock - king Steve Dunleavy , and later convinced Stone to allow him to portray Gale with an Australian accent . Also during pre-production , Stone tried to convince actress Juliette Lewis to bulk up for the role of Mallory so that she looked tougher , but she refused , saying she wanted the character to look like a pushover , not a bodybuilder . </P> <P> Principal photography took only 56 days to shoot , but the editing process went on for 11 months , with the final film containing almost 3,000 cuts ( most films have 600 -- 700 ) . Filming locations included the Rio Grande Gorge Bridge just west of Taos , New Mexico , where the wedding scene was filmed , and Stateville Correctional Center in Joliet , Illinois , where the prison riot was filmed . In Stateville , 80 % of the prisoners are incarcerated for violent crimes . For the first two weeks on location at the prison , the extras were actual inmates with rubber weapons . For the subsequent two weeks , 200 extras were needed because the Stateville inmates were on lockdown . According to Tom Sizemore , during filming on the prison set , Stone would play African tribal music at full blast between takes to keep the frantic energy up . Whilst shooting the POV scene wherein Mallory runs into the wire mesh , director of photography Robert Richardson broke his finger and the replacement cameraman cut his eye . According to Oliver Stone , he was n't too popular with the camera department on set that day . For the scenes involving rear projection , the projected footage was shot prior to principal photography , then edited together , and projected onto the stage , behind the live actors . For example , when Mallory drives past a building and flames are projected onto the wall , this was shot live using footage projected onto the facade of a real building . </P> <P> The famous Coca - Cola polar bear ad is seen twice during the film . According to Stone , Coca - Cola approved the use of the ad without having a full idea of what the film was about . When they saw the completed film , they were furious . </P> <P> The film 's soundtrack was produced by Stone and Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails , who reportedly watched the film over 50 times to `` get in the mood '' . Reznor reportedly produced the soundtrack while on tour . On his approach to compiling the soundtrack , Reznor told MTV : </P> <P> I suggested to Oliver ( Stone ) to try to turn the soundtrack into a collage - of - sound , kind of the way the movie used music : make edits , add dialog , and make it something interesting , rather than a bunch of previously released music . </P> <P> Some songs were written especially for the film or soundtrack , such as `` Burn '' by Nine Inch Nails . </P> <H2> Style </H2> <P> Natural Born Killers is shot and edited in a frenzied and psychedelic style consisting of black and white , animation , and other unusual color schemes , and employing a wide range of camera angles , filters , film stocks , lenses , and special effects . Much of the film is told via parodies of television shows , including a scene ( I Love Mallory ) presented in the style of a sitcom about a dysfunctional family . Commercials which were commonly on the air at the time of the film 's release make brief , intermittent appearances . In his DVD director 's commentary , Stone goes into great detail about the look of the film , explaining scene by scene why a particular look was chosen for a particular scene . </P> <P> According to Hollywood.com , Natural Born Killers is a satirical crime film , while Foster Hirsch deemed it `` the crime film as would - be social and cultural satire '' . Stone considered it his road film , specifically naming Bonnie and Clyde as a source of inspiration . The famous death scene in Bonnie and Clyde used innovative editing techniques provided by multiple cameras shot from different angles at different speeds ; this sporadic interchange between fast - paced and slow - motion editing that concludes Arthur Penn 's film is used throughout the entirety of Natural Born Killers . </P> <P> Furthermore , both films fall under the road film genre through their constant challenges of the society in which the characters live . While Bonnie and Clyde attempt to disintegrate the weakened economic and social landscape of the 1930s , Mickey and Mallory try to free America from the overarching conventions which influence the common masses , primarily the media . However , whilst Bonnie and Clyde concludes with a pessimistic outlook regarding individual freedom within the American sphere of influence , Oliver Stone sees Natural Born Killers as having an optimistic finale . In Bonnie and Clyde , the police 's ambush of the couple exhibits the empirical control of law enforcement over the individual . Natural Born Killers , however , ends with the couple symbolically destroying the mass media , as represented by Wayne Gale , and successfully fleeing together to live a relatively `` normal '' life . As Stone himself says , `` In its own way , Natural Born Killers is ultimately a very optimistic film about the future . It 's about freedom , and the ability of every human being to get it . '' </P> <H2> Release </H2> <H3> Box Office </H3> <Table> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> This section needs expansion . You can help by adding to it . ( November 2014 ) </Td> </Tr> </Table> <P> In its opening weekend , Natural Born Killers grossed a total of $11,166,687 in 1,510 theaters . As of January 12 , 2007 , the film had grossed a total of $50,282,766 domestically , compared to its $34 million budget . </P> <H3> Critical response </H3> <P> The film received a mixed critical response . As of December 1 , 2017 , the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes records an average response of 46 % , based on 37 reviews . However , Metacritic records a score of 74 out of 100 based on 20 reviews . Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun - Times gave the film four stars out of four and wrote , `` Seeing this movie once is not enough . The first time is for the visceral experience , the second time is for the meaning . '' On his television show , his partner Gene Siskel agreed with him , adding extra praise to the scene featuring Rodney Dangerfield . </P> <P> Other critics found the film unsuccessful in its aims . Hal Hinson of The Washington Post claimed that `` Stone 's sensibility is white - hot and personal . As much as he 'd like us to believe that his camera is turned outward on the culture , it 's vividly clear that he ca n't resist turning it inward on himself . This would n't be so troublesome if Stone did n't confuse the public and the private . '' Janet Maslin of The New York Times wrote , `` for all its surface passions , Natural Born Killers never digs deep enough to touch the madness of such events , or even to send them up in any surprising way . Mr. Stone 's vision is impassioned , alarming , visually inventive , characteristically overpowering . But it 's no match for the awful truth . '' </P> <P> James Berardinelli gave the film a negative review but his criticism was different from many other such pans , which generally said that Oliver Stone was a hypocrite for making an ultra-violent film in the guise of a critique of American attitudes . Berardinelli noted that the movie `` hits the bullseye '' as a satire of America 's lust for bloodshed , but repeated Stone 's main point so often and so loudly that it became unbearable . </P> <P> Lionsgate Films released a director 's cut on DVD . Stone himself retained ownership of his preferred cut . Distribution rights to the director 's cut reverted from Lionsgate to Warner Bros. in 2009 , giving Warner all distribution rights . </P> <H2> Controversies </H2> <H3> Censorship </H3> <P> When the film was first handed in to the MPAA , they told Stone they would give it an NC - 17 unless he cut it . As such , Stone toned down the violence by cutting approximately four minutes of footage , and the MPAA re-rated the film as an R. In 1996 , a Director 's Cut was released on home video by Vidmark Entertainment and Pioneer Entertainment , as Warner Bros. wanted nothing to do with that particular version . Warner Home Video later released this cut on Blu - ray . </P> <P> The film was banned completely upon release in Ireland , including -- controversially -- from cinema clubs , in significant part because the principal characters have Irish names . The ban was later quietly lifted . </P> <P> In the UK , though the cinema release was delayed while the BBFC investigated reports that the film caused copycat murders in the USA and France , it was finally shown in cinemas in February 1995 . </P> <P> The original intended UK home video release in March 1996 was cancelled due to the Dunblane massacre in Scotland . In the meantime , Channel Five showed the film in November 1997 . It was finally released on video in July 2001 . </P> <P> Entertainment Weekly ranked the film as the eighth most controversial film ever . </P> <H3> `` Copycat '' crimes </H3> Main article : Natural Born Killers copycat crimes <P> From almost the moment of its release , the film has been accused of encouraging and inspiring numerous murderers in North America , including the Heath High School shooting and the Columbine High School massacre . </P> <H2> Soundtrack </H2> Main article : Natural Born Killers ( soundtrack ) <P> The soundtrack was released August 23 , 1994 by Interscope Records . </P> <Ol> <Li> `` Waiting for the Miracle '' ( Edit ) -- Leonard Cohen </Li> <Li> `` Shitlist '' -- L7 </Li> <Li> `` Moon Over Greene County '' ( Edit ) -- Dan Zanes </Li> <Li> `` Rock N Roll Nigger '' ( Flood Remix ) -- Patti Smith </Li> <Li> `` Sweet Jane '' ( Edit ) -- Cowboy Junkies </Li> <Li> `` You Belong to Me '' -- Bob Dylan </Li> <Li> `` The Trembler '' ( Edit ) -- Duane Eddy </Li> <Li> `` Burn '' -- Nine Inch Nails </Li> <Li> `` Route 666 '' -- BB Tone Brian Berdan featuring Robert Downey Jr . </Li> <Li> `` Totally Hot '' -- Remmy Ongala & Orchestre Super Matimila </Li> <Li> `` Back in Baby 's Arms '' -- Patsy Cline </Li> <Li> `` Taboo '' ( Edit ) -- Peter Gabriel and Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan </Li> <Li> `` Sex is Violent '' -- Jane 's Addiction and Diamanda Gal\u00e1s ( based on `` Ted , Just Admit It ...

Tarantino had sold <wd_idx<2650>> an option for his script to producers Jane Hamsher and <wd_idx<2660>> Don Murphy for $10,000 after he had tried , and <wd_idx<2670>> failed , to direct it himself for $500,000 . Hamsher <wd_idx<2680>> and Murphy subsequently sold the screenplay to Warner Bros. Around <wd_idx<2690>> the same time , Oliver Stone was made aware of <wd_idx<2700>> the script . He was keen to find something more <wd_idx<2710>> straightforward than his previous production , Heaven & Earth ; <wd_id", "<wd_idx<2690>> the same time , Oliver Stone was made aware of <wd_idx<2700>> the script . He was keen to find something more <wd_idx<2710>> straightforward than his previous production , Heaven & Earth ; <wd_idx<2720>> a difficult shoot which had left him exhausted , and <wd_idx<2730>> he felt that Natural Born Killers could be what he <wd_idx<2740>> was looking for . </P> <P> David Veloz , associate <wd_idx<2750>> producer Richard Rutowski , and Stone rewrote the script , <wd_idx<2760>> keeping much of the dialogue but changing the focus of <wd_idx<2770>> the film from journalist Wayne Gale to Mickey and Mallory <wd_idx<2780>> . The script was changed so much that as per <wd_idx<2790>> WGA rules , Tarantino was credited for the film 's <wd_idx<2800>> story only . In a 1993 interview , Tarantino stated <wd_idx<2810>> that he did not hold any animosity towards Stone , <wd_idx<2820>> and that he wished the film well ; </P> <P> <wd_idx<2830>> `` It 's not going to be my movie", "<wd_idx<2810>> that he did not hold any animosity towards Stone , <wd_idx<2820>> and that he wished the film well ; </P> <P> <wd_idx<2830>> `` It 's not going to be my movie , <wd_idx<2840>> it 's going to be Oliver Stone 's , and <wd_idx<2850>> God bless him . I hope he does a good <wd_idx<2860>> job with it . If I was n't emotionally attached <wd_idx<2870>> to it , I 'm sure I would find it <wd_idx<2880>> very interesting . If you like my stuff , you <wd_idx<2890>> might not like this movie . But if you like <wd_idx<2900>> his stuff , you 're probably going to love it <wd_idx<2910>> . It might be the best thing he 's ever <wd_idx<2920>> done , but not because of anything to do with <wd_idx<2930>> me . ( ... ) I actually ca n't wait <wd_idx<2940>> to see it , to tell you the truth . <wd_idx<2950>> '' </P> <P> Initially , when producers Hamsher and Murphy <wd_idx<2960>> had first brought the script to Stone '", "<wd_idx<2940>> to see it , to tell you the truth . <wd_idx<2950>> '' </P> <P> Initially , when producers Hamsher and Murphy <wd_idx<2960>> had first brought the script to Stone 's attention , <wd_idx<2970>> he had seen it as an action film ; `` <wd_idx<2980>> something Arnold Schwarzenegger would be proud of . '' As <wd_idx<2990>> the project developed however , incidents such as the O.J. <wd_idx<3000>> Simpson case , the Menendez brothers case , the Tonya <wd_idx<3010>> Harding / Nancy Kerrigan incident , the Rodney King incident <wd_idx<3020>> , and the Federal assault of the Branch Davidian sect <wd_idx<3030>> all took place . Stone came to feel that the <wd_idx<3040>> media was heavily involved in the outcome of all of <wd_idx<3050>> these cases , and that the media had become an <wd_idx<3060>> all - pervasive entity which marketed violence and suffering for <wd_idx<3070>> the good of ratings . As such , he changed <wd_idx<3080>> the tone of the movie from one of simple action <wd_id", "<wd_idx<3060>> all - pervasive entity which marketed violence and suffering for <wd_idx<3070>> the good of ratings . As such , he changed <wd_idx<3080>> the tone of the movie from one of simple action <wd_idx<3090>> to a satirical critique of the media in general . <wd_idx<3100>> Also coloring Stone 's approach , and contributing to the <wd_idx<3110>> violent nature of the film , were the anger and <wd_idx<3120>> sadness he felt at the breakdown of his second marriage <wd_idx<3130>> . He also said in an interview that the film <wd_idx<3140>> was influenced by the `` vitality '' of Indian cinema <wd_idx<3150>> . He let Rodney Dangerfield write or rewrite all of <wd_idx<3160>> his own character 's lines . </P> <P> During pre-production <wd_idx<3170>> , to prepare for the role of Wayne Gale , <wd_idx<3180>> Downey spent time with Australian TV shock - king Steve <wd_idx<3190>> Dunleavy , and later convinced Stone to allow him to <wd_idx<3200>> portray Gale with an Australian accent . Also during pre-production <wd_idx<3210>> , Stone tried to convince actress Juliette Lewis to", "<wd_idx<3190>> Dunleavy , and later convinced Stone to allow him to <wd_idx<3200>> portray Gale with an Australian accent . Also during pre-production <wd_idx<3210>> , Stone tried to convince actress Juliette Lewis to bulk <wd_idx<3220>> up for the role of Mallory so that she looked <wd_idx<3230>> tougher , but she refused , saying she wanted the <wd_idx<3240>> character to look like a pushover , not a bodybuilder <wd_idx<3250>> . </P> <P> Principal photography took only 56 days to <wd_idx<3260>> shoot , but the editing process went on for 11 <wd_idx<3270>> months , with the final film containing almost 3,000 cuts <wd_idx<3280>> ( most films have 600 -- 700 ) . Filming <wd_idx<3290>> locations included the Rio Grande Gorge Bridge just west of <wd_idx<3300>> Taos , New Mexico , where the wedding scene was <wd_idx<3310>> filmed , and Stateville Correctional Center in Joliet , Illinois <wd_idx<3320>> , where the prison riot was filmed . In Stateville <wd_idx<3330>> , 80 % of the prisoners are incarcerated for violent ", "<wd_idx<3310>> filmed , and Stateville Correctional Center in Joliet , Illinois <wd_idx<3320>> , where the prison riot was filmed . In Stateville <wd_idx<3330>> , 80 % of the prisoners are incarcerated for violent <wd_idx<3340>> crimes . For the first two weeks on location at <wd_idx<3350>> the prison , the extras were actual inmates with rubber <wd_idx<3360>> weapons . For the subsequent two weeks , 200 extras <wd_idx<3370>> were needed because the Stateville inmates were on lockdown . <wd_idx<3380>> According to Tom Sizemore , during filming on the prison <wd_idx<3390>> set , Stone would play African tribal music at full <wd_idx<3400>> blast between takes to keep the frantic energy up . <wd_idx<3410>> Whilst shooting the POV scene wherein Mallory runs into the <wd_idx<3420>> wire mesh , director of photography Robert Richardson broke his <wd_idx<3430>> finger and the replacement cameraman cut his eye . According <wd_idx<3440>> to Oliver Stone , he was n't too popular with <wd_idx<3450>> the camera department on set that day . For the <wd_idx<3460>> scenes involving rear projection , the projected footage was shot <wd_", "<wd_idx<3440>> to Oliver Stone , he was n't too popular with <wd_idx<3450>> the camera department on set that day . For the <wd_idx<3460>> scenes involving rear projection , the projected footage was shot <wd_idx<3470>> prior to principal photography , then edited together , and <wd_idx<3480>> projected onto the stage , behind the live actors . <wd_idx<3490>> For example , when Mallory drives past a building and <wd_idx<3500>> flames are projected onto the wall , this was shot <wd_idx<3510>> live using footage projected onto the facade of a real <wd_idx<3520>> building . </P> <P> The famous Coca - Cola polar <wd_idx<3530>> bear ad is seen twice during the film . According <wd_idx<3540>> to Stone , Coca - Cola approved the use of <wd_idx<3550>> the ad without having a full idea of what the <wd_idx<3560>> film was about . When they saw the completed film <wd_idx<3570>> , they were furious . </P> <P> The film 's <wd_idx<3580>> soundtrack was produced by Stone and Trent Reznor of Nine <wd_idx<3590>> Inch Nails , who reportedly watched", "<wd_idx<3570>> , they were furious . </P> <P> The film 's <wd_idx<3580>> soundtrack was produced by Stone and Trent Reznor of Nine <wd_idx<3590>> Inch Nails , who reportedly watched the film over 50 <wd_idx<3600>> times to `` get in the mood '' . Reznor <wd_idx<3610>> reportedly produced the soundtrack while on tour . On his <wd_idx<3620>> approach to compiling the soundtrack , Reznor told MTV : <wd_idx<3630>> </P> <P> I suggested to Oliver ( Stone ) to <wd_idx<3640>> try to turn the soundtrack into a collage - of <wd_idx<3650>> - sound , kind of the way the movie used <wd_idx<3660>> music : make edits , add dialog , and make <wd_idx<3670>> it something interesting , rather than a bunch of previously <wd_idx<3680>> released music . </P> <P> Some songs were written especially <wd_idx<3690>> for the film or soundtrack , such as `` Burn <wd_idx<3700>> '' by Nine Inch Nails . </P> <H2> Style </H2> <wd_idx<3710>> <P> Natural", "<wd_idx<3690>> for the film or soundtrack , such as `` Burn <wd_idx<3700>> '' by Nine Inch Nails . </P> <H2> Style </H2> <wd_idx<3710>> <P> Natural Born Killers is shot and edited in a <wd_idx<3720>> frenzied and psychedelic style consisting of black and white , <wd_idx<3730>> animation , and other unusual color schemes , and employing <wd_idx<3740>> a wide range of camera angles , filters , film <wd_idx<3750>> stocks , lenses , and special effects . Much of <wd_idx<3760>> the film is told via parodies of television shows , <wd_idx<3770>> including a scene ( I Love Mallory ) presented in <wd_idx<3780>> the style of a sitcom about a dysfunctional family . <wd_idx<3790>> Commercials which were commonly on the air at the time <wd_idx<3800>> of the film 's release make brief , intermittent appearances <wd_idx<3810>> . In his DVD director 's commentary , Stone goes <wd_idx<3820>> into great detail about the look of the film , <wd_idx<3830>> explaining scene by scene why a particular look was chosen <wd_", "<wd_idx<3810>> . In his DVD director 's commentary , Stone goes <wd_idx<3820>> into great detail about the look of the film , <wd_idx<3830>> explaining scene by scene why a particular look was chosen <wd_idx<3840>> for a particular scene . </P> <P> According to Hollywood.com <wd_idx<3850>> , Natural Born Killers is a satirical crime film , <wd_idx<3860>> while Foster Hirsch deemed it `` the crime film as <wd_idx<3870>> would - be social and cultural satire '' . Stone <wd_idx<3880>> considered it his road film , specifically naming Bonnie and <wd_idx<3890>> Clyde as a source of inspiration . The famous death <wd_idx<3900>> scene in Bonnie and Clyde used innovative editing techniques provided <wd_idx<3910>> by multiple cameras shot from different angles at different speeds <wd_idx<3920>> ; this sporadic interchange between fast - paced and slow <wd_idx<3930>> - motion editing that concludes Arthur Penn 's film is <wd_idx<3940>> used throughout the entirety of Natural Born Killers . </P> <wd_idx<3950>> <P> Furthermore , both films fall under the road film <wd_idx<3960>> genre through their constant challenges of the society in", "<wd_idx<3940>> used throughout the entirety of Natural Born Killers . </P> <wd_idx<3950>> <P> Furthermore , both films fall under the road film <wd_idx<3960>> genre through their constant challenges of the society in which <wd_idx<3970>> the characters live . While Bonnie and Clyde attempt to <wd_idx<3980>> disintegrate the weakened economic and social landscape of the 1930s <wd_idx<3990>> , Mickey and Mallory try to free America from the <wd_idx<4000>> overarching conventions which influence the common masses , primarily the <wd_idx<4010>> media . However , whilst Bonnie and Clyde concludes with <wd_idx<4020>> a pessimistic outlook regarding individual freedom within the American sphere <wd_idx<4030>> of influence , Oliver Stone sees Natural Born Killers as <wd_idx<4040>> having an optimistic finale . In Bonnie and Clyde , <wd_idx<4050>> the police 's ambush of the couple exhibits the empirical <wd_idx<4060>> control of law enforcement over the individual . Natural Born <wd_idx<4070>> Killers , however , ends with the couple symbolically destroying <wd_idx<4080>> the mass media , as represented by Wayne Gale , <wd_idx<4090>> and successfully fleeing together to live a relatively `` normal <wd", "<wd_idx<4070>> Killers , however , ends with the couple symbolically destroying <wd_idx<4080>> the mass media , as represented by Wayne Gale , <wd_idx<4090>> and successfully fleeing together to live a relatively `` normal <wd_idx<4100>> '' life . As Stone himself says , `` In <wd_idx<4110>> its own way , Natural Born Killers is ultimately a <wd_idx<4120>> very optimistic film about the future . It 's about <wd_idx<4130>> freedom , and the ability of every human being to <wd_idx<4140>> get it .

Hal Hinson of The Washington <wd_idx<4360>> Post claimed that `` Stone 's sensibility is white - <wd_idx<4370>> hot and personal .

Mr. Stone <wd_idx<4470>> 's vision is impassioned , alarming , visually inventive , <wd_idx<4480>> characteristically overpowering . But it 's no match for the <wd_idx<4490>> awful truth . '' </P> <P> James Berardinelli gave the <wd_idx<4500>> film a negative review but his criticism was different from <wd_idx<4510>> many other such pans , which generally said that Oliver <wd_idx<4520>> Stone was a hypocrite for making an ultra-violent film in <wd_idx<4530>> the guise of a critique of American attitudes .

There are two types of motor neuron -- upper motor neurons and lower motor neurons . Axons from upper motor neurons synapse onto interneurons in the spinal cord and occasionally directly onto lower motor neurons . The axons from the lower motor neurons are efferent nerve fibers that carry signals from the spinal cord to the effectors . Types of lower motor neurons are alpha motor neurons , beta motor neurons , and gamma motor neurons . </P> <P> The term ' motor neuron ' is usually restricted to the lower motor neurons , the efferent nerves that directly innervate muscles . </P> <P> A single motor neuron may innervate many muscle fibres and a muscle fibre can undergo many action potentials in the time taken for a single muscle twitch . As a result , if an action potential arrives before a twitch has completed , the twitches can superimpose on one another , either through summation or a tetanic contraction . In summation , the muscle is stimulated repetitively such that additional action potentials coming from the somatic nervous system arrive before the end of the twitch . The twitches thus superimpose on one another , leading to a force greater than that of a single twitch . A tetanic contraction is caused by constant , very high frequency stimulation - the action potentials come at such a rapid rate that individual twitches are indistinguishable , and tension rises smoothly eventually reaching a plateau . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Development </Li> <Li> 2 Anatomy and physiology <Ul> <Li> 2.1 Upper motor neurons </Li> <Li> 2.2 White Matter Tract </Li> <Li> 2.3 Lower Motor Neurons </Li> <Li> 2.4 Somatic motor neurons <Ul> <Li> 2.4. 1 Neuromuscular Junction </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 2.5 Special visceral motor neurons </Li> <Li> 2.6 General visceral motor neurons </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 3 Motor neurons in regenerative medicine </Li> <Li> 4 See also </Li> <Li> 5 References </Li> <Li> 6 Sources </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> Development ( edit ) </H2> <P> Motor neurons begin to develop early in embryonic development , and motor function continues to develop well into childhood . In the neural tube cells are specified to either the rostral - caudal axis or ventral - dorsal axis . The axons of motor neurons begin to appear in the fourth week of development from the ventral region of the ventral - dorsal axis ( the basal plate ) . This homeodomain is known as the motor neural progenitor domain ( pMN ) . Transcription factors genes here include the Pax6 , OLIG2 , Nkx6. 1 , and Nkx6. 2 factors , which are regulated by sonic hedgehog ( Shh ) . The OLIG2 gene being the most important due to its role in promoting Ngn2 expression , a gene that causes cell cycle exiting as well as promoting further transcription factors associated with motor neuron development . </P> <P> Further specification of motor neurons occurs when retinoic acid , fibroblast growth factor , Wnts , and TGFb , are integrated into the various Hox transcription factors . There are 13 Hox transcription factors and - along with the signals - these determine whether a motor neuron will be more rostral or caudal in character . In the spinal column Hox 4 - 11 sort motor neurons to one of the five motor columns . These columns are further explained in the table below . </P> <Table> Motor Columns of Spinal Cord <Tr> <Td> Motor Column </Td> <Td> Location in Spinal Cord </Td> <Td> Target </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Median Motor Column </Td> <Td> Present entire length </Td> <Td> Axial muscles </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Hypaxial Motor Column </Td> <Td> Thoracic Region </Td> <Td> Body wall muscles </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Preganglionic Motor Column </Td> <Td> Thoracic Region </Td> <Td> Sympathetic ganglion </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Laterl Motor Column </Td> <Td> Brachial and Lumbar region ( both regions are further divided into medial and lateral domains ) </Td> <Td> Muscles of the limbs </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Phrenic Motor Coulmn </Td> <Td> Cervical Region </Td> <Td> Diaphragm </Td> </Tr> </Table> <H2> Anatomy and Physiology ( edit ) </H2> Spinal cord tracts Location of lower motor neurons in spinal cord <H3> Upper motor neurons ( edit ) </H3> <P> Upper motor neurons originate in the motor cortex located in the precentral gyrus . The cells that make up the primary motor cortex are Betz cells , which are a type of pyramidal cell . The axons of these cells descend from the cortex to form the corticospinal tract . </P> <H3> White matter Tract ( edit ) </H3> <P> White matter tracts are bundles of axons and serve as means to propagate nerve impulses on a large scale . These are found in the spinal cord and appear white from the myelin surrounding axons . While these tracts exist for both efferent and afferent nerves , efferent nerves will carry signals down the spinal cord toward their effector target . These tracts also serve as the place of origin for lower motor neurons . There are seven major white matter motor tracts to be found in the spinal cord and are listed below : </P> <Ul> <Li> Lateral Corticospinal Tract </Li> <Li> Rubrospinal Tract </Li> <Li> Lateral Reticulospinal Tract </Li> <Li> Vestibulospinal tract </Li> <Li> Medial Reticulospinal Tract </Li> <Li> Tectospinal Tract </Li> <Li> Anterior Corticospinal Tract </Li> </Ul> <H3> Lower motor neurons ( edit ) </H3> <P> Lower motor neurons are those that originate in the spinal cord and directly or indirectly innervate effector targets . The target of these neurons varies , but in the somatic nervous system the target will be some sort of muscle fiber . There are three primary categories lower motor neurons , which can be further divided in sub-categories . </P> <P> According to their targets , motor neurons are classified into three broad categories : </P> <Ul> <Li> Somatic motor neurons </Li> <Li> Special visceral motor neurons </Li> <Li> General visceral motor neurons </Li> </Ul> <H3> Somatic motor neurons ( edit ) </H3> <P> Somatic motor neurons originate in the central nervous system , project their axons to skeletal muscles ( such as the muscles of the limbs , abdominal , and intercostal muscles ) , which are involved in locomotion . The three types of these neurons are the alpha efferent neurons , beta efferent neurons , and gamma efferent neurons . They are called efferent to indicate the flow of information from the central nervous system ( CNS ) to the periphery . </P> <Ul> <Li> Alpha motor neurons innervate extrafusal muscle fibers , which are the main force - generating component of a muscle . Their cell bodies are in the ventral horn of the spinal cord and they are sometimes called ventral horn cells . A single motor neuron may synapse with 150 muscle fibers on average . The motor neuron and all of the muscle fibers to which it connects is a motor unit . Motor units are split up into 3 categories : Main Article : Motor Unit <Ul> <Li> Slow ( S ) motor units stimulate small muscle fibers , which contract very slowly and provide small amounts of energy but are very resistant to fatigue , so they are used to sustain muscular contraction , such as keeping the body upright . They gain their energy via oxidative means and hence require oxygen . They are also called red fibers . </Li> <Li> Fast fatiguing ( FF ) motor units stimulate larger muscle groups , which apply large amounts of force but fatigue very quickly . They are used for tasks that require large brief bursts on energy , such as jumping or running . They gain their energy via glycolytic means and hence do n't require oxygen . They are called white fibers . </Li> <Li> Fast fatigue - resistant motor units stimulate moderate - sized muscles groups that do n't react as fast as the FF motor units , but can be sustained much longer ( as implied by the name ) and provide more force than S motor units . These use both oxidative and glycolytic means to gain energy . </Li> </Ul> </Li> </Ul> <P> In addition to voluntary skeletal muscle contraction , alpha motor neurons also contribute to muscle tone , the continuous force generated by noncontracting muscle to oppose stretching . When a muscle is stretched , sensory neurons within the muscle spindle detect the degree of stretch and send a signal to the CNS . The CNS activates alpha motor neurons in the spinal cord , which cause extrafusal muscle fibers to contract and thereby resist further stretching . This process is also called the stretch reflex . </P> <Ul> <Li> Beta motor neurons innervate intrafusal muscle fibers of muscle spindles , with collaterals to extrafusal fibres . There are two types of beta motor neurons : Slow Contracting - These innervate extrafusal fibers . Fast Contracting - These innervate intrafusal fibers . </Li> <Li> Gamma motor neurons innervate intrafusal muscle fibers found within the muscle spindle . They regulate the sensitivity of the spindle to muscle stretching . With activation of gamma neurons , intrafusal muscle fibers contract so that only a small stretch is required to activate spindle sensory neurons and the stretch reflex . There are two types of gamma motor neurons : Dynamic - These focus on Bag1 fibers and enhance dynamic sensitivity . Static - These focus on Bag2 fibers and enhance stretch sensitivity . </Li> <Li> Regulatory factors of lower motor Neurons Size Principle -- this relates to the of the soma of the motor neuron . This restricts larger neurons to receive a larger excitatory signal in order to stimulate the muscle fibers it innervates . By reducing unnecessary muscle fiber recruitment , the body is able to optimize energy consumption . Persistent Inward Current ( PIC ) -- recent animal study research has shown that constant flow of ions such as calcium and sodium through channels in the soma and dendrites influence the synaptic input . An alternate way to think of this is that the post-synaptic neuron is being primed before receiving an impulse . After Hyper - polarization ( AHP ) -- we are all familiar with the idea of hyperpolarization after an action potential . A trend has been identified that shows slow motor neurons to have more intense AHPs for a longer duration . One way to remember this is that slow muscle fibers can contract for loner , so it makes since that their corresponding motor neurons fire at a slower rate . </Li> </Ul> Neuromuscular junction ( edit ) <P> The interface between a motor neuron and muscle fiber is a specialized synapse called the neuromuscular junction . Upon adequate stimulation , the motor neuron releases a flood of acetylcholine ( Ach ) neurotransmitters from the axon terminals from synaptic vesicles bind with the plasma membrane . The acetylcholine molecules bind to postsynaptic receptors found within the motor end plate . Once two acetylcholine receptors have been bound , an ion channel is opened and sodium ions are allowed to flow into the cell . The influx of sodium into the cell causes depolarization and triggers a muscle action potential . T tubules of the sarcolemma are then stimulated to elicit calcium ion release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum . It is this chemical release that causes the target muscle fiber to contract . </P> <Ul> <Li> In invertebrates , depending on the neurotransmitter released and the type of receptor it binds , the response in the muscle fiber could be either excitatory or inhibitory . </Li> <Li> For vertebrates , however , the response of a muscle fiber to a neurotransmitter can only be excitatory , in other words , contractile . Muscle relaxation and inhibition of muscle contraction in vertebrates is obtained only by inhibition of the motor neuron itself . Muscle innervation may eventually play a role in the maturation of motor activity . This is how muscle relaxants work by acting on the motor neurons that innervate muscles ( by decreasing their electrophysiological activity ) or on cholinergic neuromuscular junctions , rather than on the muscles themselves . </Li> </Ul> <H3> Special visceral motor neurons ( edit ) </H3> <P> These are also known as branchial motor neurons , which are involved in facial expression , mastication , phonation , and swallowing . Associated cranial nerves are the oculomotor , abducens , trochlear , and hypoglossal nerves . </P> <Table> <Tr> <Th> Branch of NS </Th> <Th> Position </Th> <Th> Neurotransmitter </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Somatic </Td> <Td> n / a </Td> <Td> Acetylcholine </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Parasympathetic </Td> <Td> Preganglionic </Td> <Td> Acetylcholine </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Parasympathetic </Td> <Td> Ganglionic </Td> <Td> Acetylcholine </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Sympathetic </Td> <Td> Preganglionic </Td> <Td> Acetylcholine </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Sympathetic </Td> <Td> Ganglionic </Td> <Td> Norepinephrine * </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td_colspan=\"3\"> * Except fibers to sweat glands and certain blood vessels Motor neuron neurotransmitters </Td> </Tr> </Table> <H3> General visceral motor neurons ( edit ) </H3> <P> These motor neurons indirectly innervate cardiac muscle and smooth muscles of the viscera ( the muscles of the arteries ) : they synapse onto neurons located in ganglia of the autonomic nervous system ( sympathetic and parasympathetic ) , located in the peripheral nervous system ( PNS ) , which themselves directly innervate visceral muscles ( and also some gland cells ) . </P> <P> In consequence : </P> <Ul> <Li> the motor command of skeletal and branchial muscles is monosynaptic ( involving only one motor neuron , respectively , somatic and branchial , which synapses onto the muscle ) . </Li> <Li> the command of visceral muscles is disynaptic ( involving two neurons : the general visceral motor neuron located in the CNS , which synapses onto a ganglionic neuron , located in the PNS , which synapses onto the muscle ) . </Li> </Ul> <P> All vertebrate motor neurons are cholinergic , that is , they release the neurotransmitter acetylcholine . Parasympathetic ganglionic neurons are also cholinergic , whereas most sympathetic ganglionic neurons are noradrenergic , that is , they release the neurotransmitter noradrenaline .

There are two types of motor neuron <wd_idx<260>> -- upper motor neurons and lower motor neurons . Axons <wd_idx<270>> from upper motor neurons synapse onto interneurons in the spinal <wd_idx<280>> cord and occasionally directly onto lower motor neurons . The <wd_idx<290>> axons from the lower motor neurons are efferent nerve fibers <wd_idx<300>> that carry signals from the spinal cord to the effectors <wd_id", "<wd_idx<280>> cord and occasionally directly onto lower motor neurons . The <wd_idx<290>> axons from the lower motor neurons are efferent nerve fibers <wd_idx<300>> that carry signals from the spinal cord to the effectors <wd_idx<310>> . Types of lower motor neurons are alpha motor neurons <wd_idx<320>> , beta motor neurons , and gamma motor neurons . <wd_idx<330>> </P> <P> The term ' motor neuron ' is usually <wd_idx<340>> restricted to the lower motor neurons , the efferent nerves <wd_idx<350>> that directly innervate muscles . </P> <P> A single motor <wd_idx<360>> neuron may innervate many muscle fibres and a muscle fibre <wd_idx<370>> can undergo many action potentials in the time taken for <wd_idx<380>> a single muscle twitch . As a result , if <wd_idx<390>> an action potential arrives before a twitch has completed , <wd_idx<400>> the twitches can superimpose on one another , either through <wd_idx<410>> summation or a tetanic contraction . In summation , the <wd_idx<420>> muscle is stimulated repetitively such that additional action potentials coming <wd_idx<430>> from the somatic nervous system arrive before the end of ", "<wd_idx<410>> summation or a tetanic contraction . In summation , the <wd_idx<420>> muscle is stimulated repetitively such that additional action potentials coming <wd_idx<430>> from the somatic nervous system arrive before the end of <wd_idx<440>> the twitch . The twitches thus superimpose on one another <wd_idx<450>> , leading to a force greater than that of a <wd_idx<460>> single twitch . A tetanic contraction is caused by constant <wd_idx<470>> , very high frequency stimulation - the action potentials come <wd_idx<480>> at such a rapid rate that individual twitches are indistinguishable <wd_idx<490>> , and tension rises smoothly eventually reaching a plateau . <wd_idx<500>> </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <wd_idx<510>> <Li> 1 Development </Li> <Li> 2 Anatomy and physiology <Ul> <wd_idx<520>> <Li> 2.1 Upper motor neurons </Li> <Li> 2.2 White Matter <wd_idx<530>> Tract </Li> <Li> 2.3 Lower Motor Neurons </Li> <Li> 2.4 <wd_idx<540>> Somatic motor neurons <Ul> <Li> 2.4. 1 Neuromuscular", "<wd_idx<530>> Tract </Li> <Li> 2.3 Lower Motor Neurons </Li> <Li> 2.4 <wd_idx<540>> Somatic motor neurons <Ul> <Li> 2.4. 1 Neuromuscular Junction </Li> <wd_idx<550>> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 2.5 Special visceral motor neurons </Li> <Li> <wd_idx<560>> 2.6 General visceral motor neurons </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 3 <wd_idx<570>> Motor neurons in regenerative medicine </Li> <Li> 4 See also <wd_idx<580>> </Li> <Li> 5 References </Li> <Li> 6 Sources </Li> </Ul> <wd_idx<590>> <P> </P> <H2> Development ( edit ) </H2> <P> Motor <wd_idx<600>> neurons begin to develop early in embryonic development , and <wd_idx<610>> motor function continues to develop well into childhood .

The target of these neurons <wd_idx<1200>> varies , but in the somatic nervous system the target <wd_idx<1210>> will be some sort of muscle fiber . There are <wd_idx<1220>> three primary categories lower motor neurons , which can be <wd_idx<1230>> further divided in sub-categories . </P> <P> According to their <wd_idx<1240>> targets , motor neurons are classified into three broad categories <wd_idx<1250>> : </P> <Ul> <Li> Somatic motor neurons </Li> <Li> Special <wd_idx<1260>> visceral motor neurons </Li> <Li> General visceral motor neurons </Li> <wd_idx<1270>> </Ul> <H3> Somatic motor neurons ( edit ) </H3> <P> <wd_idx", "<wd_idx<1260>> visceral motor neurons </Li> <Li> General visceral motor neurons </Li> <wd_idx<1270>> </Ul> <H3> Somatic motor neurons ( edit ) </H3> <P> <wd_idx<1280>> Somatic motor neurons originate in the central nervous system , <wd_idx<1290>> project their axons to skeletal muscles ( such as the <wd_idx<1300>> muscles of the limbs , abdominal , and intercostal muscles <wd_idx<1310>> ) , which are involved in locomotion . The three <wd_idx<1320>> types of these neurons are the alpha efferent neurons , <wd_idx<1330>> beta efferent neurons , and gamma efferent neurons . They <wd_idx<1340>> are called efferent to indicate the flow of information from <wd_idx<1350>> the central nervous system ( CNS ) to the periphery <wd_idx<1360>> . </P> <Ul> <Li> Alpha motor neurons innervate extrafusal muscle <wd_idx<1370>> fibers , which are the main force - generating component <wd_idx<1380>> of a muscle . Their cell bodies are in the <wd_idx<1390>> ventral horn of the spinal cord and they are sometimes <wd_", "<wd_idx<1370>> fibers , which are the main force - generating component <wd_idx<1380>> of a muscle . Their cell bodies are in the <wd_idx<1390>> ventral horn of the spinal cord and they are sometimes <wd_idx<1400>> called ventral horn cells . A single motor neuron may <wd_idx<1410>> synapse with 150 muscle fibers on average . The motor <wd_idx<1420>> neuron and all of the muscle fibers to which it <wd_idx<1430>> connects is a motor unit . Motor units are split <wd_idx<1440>> up into 3 categories : Main Article : Motor Unit <wd_idx<1450>> <Ul> <Li> Slow ( S ) motor units stimulate small <wd_idx<1460>> muscle fibers , which contract very slowly and provide small <wd_idx<1470>> amounts of energy but are very resistant to fatigue , <wd_idx<1480>> so they are used to sustain muscular contraction , such <wd_idx<1490>> as keeping the body upright . They gain their energy <wd_idx<1500>> via oxidative means and hence require oxygen .

They are <wd_idx<1510>> also called red fibers . </Li> <Li> Fast fatiguing ( <wd_idx<1520>> FF ) motor units stimulate larger muscle groups , which <wd_idx<1530>> apply large amounts of force but fatigue very quickly . <wd_idx<1540>> They are used for tasks that require large brief bursts <wd_idx<1550>> on energy , such as jumping or running . They <wd_idx<1560>> gain their energy via glycolytic means and hence do n't <wd_idx<1570>> require oxygen . They are called white fibers . </Li> <wd_idx<1580>> <Li> Fast fatigue - resistant motor units stimulate moderate - <wd_idx<1590>> sized muscles groups that do n't react as fast as <wd_idx<1600>> the FF motor units , but can be sustained much <wd_idx<1610>> longer ( as implied by the name ) and provide <wd_idx<1620>> more force than S motor units .

When a muscle is stretched , sensory neurons within <wd_idx<1680>> the muscle spindle detect the degree of stretch and send <wd_idx<1690>> a signal to the CNS . The CNS activates alpha <wd_idx<1700>> motor neurons in the spinal cord , which cause extrafusal <wd_idx<1710>> muscle fibers to contract and thereby resist further stretching . <wd_idx<1720>> This process is also called the stretch reflex . </P> <wd_idx<1730>> <Ul> <Li> Beta motor neurons innervate intrafusal muscle fibers of <wd_idx<1740>> muscle spindles , with collaterals to extrafusal fibres . There <wd_idx<1750>> are two types of beta motor neurons : Slow Contracting <wd_idx<1760>> - These innervate extra", "<wd_idx<1740>> muscle spindles , with collaterals to extrafusal fibres . There <wd_idx<1750>> are two types of beta motor neurons : Slow Contracting <wd_idx<1760>> - These innervate extrafusal fibers . Fast Contracting - These <wd_idx<1770>> innervate intrafusal fibers . </Li> <Li> Gamma motor neurons innervate <wd_idx<1780>> intrafusal muscle fibers found within the muscle spindle . They <wd_idx<1790>> regulate the sensitivity of the spindle to muscle stretching . <wd_idx<1800>> With activation of gamma neurons , intrafusal muscle fibers contract <wd_idx<1810>> so that only a small stretch is required to activate <wd_idx<1820>> spindle sensory neurons and the stretch reflex . There are <wd_idx<1830>> two types of gamma motor neurons : Dynamic - These <wd_idx<1840>> focus on Bag1 fibers and enhance dynamic sensitivity .

This restricts larger neurons to receive <wd_idx<1890>> a larger excitatory signal in order to stimulate the muscle <wd_idx<1900>> fibers it innervates . By reducing unnecessary muscle fiber recruitment <wd_idx<1910>> , the body is able to optimize energy consumption . <wd_idx<1920>> Persistent Inward Current ( PIC ) -- recent animal study <wd_idx<1930>> research has shown that constant flow of ions such as <wd_idx<1940>> calcium and sodium through channels in the soma and dendrites <wd_idx<1950>> influence the synaptic input .

A trend has <wd_idx<2000>> been identified that shows slow motor neurons to have more <wd_idx<2010>> intense AHPs for a longer duration . One way to <wd_idx<2020>> remember this is that slow muscle fibers can contract for <wd_idx<2030>> loner , so it makes since that their corresponding motor <wd_idx<2040>> neurons fire at a slower rate . </Li> </Ul> Neuromuscular <wd_idx<2050>> junction ( edit ) <P> The interface between a motor <wd_idx<2060>> neuron and muscle fiber is a specialized synapse called the <wd_idx<2070>> neuromuscular junction . Upon adequate stimulation , the motor neuron <wd_idx<2080>> releases a flood of acetylcholine ( Ach ) neurotransmitters from <wd_idx<2090>> the axon terminals from synaptic vesicles bind with the plasma <wd_idx<2100>> membrane .

The acetylcholine molecules bind to postsynaptic receptors found <wd_idx<2110>> within the motor end plate . Once two acetylcholine receptors <wd_idx<2120>> have been bound , an ion channel is opened and <wd_idx<2130>> sodium ions are allowed to flow into the cell . <wd_idx<2140>> The influx of sodium into the cell causes depolarization and <wd_idx<2150>> triggers a muscle action potential . T tubules of the <wd_idx<2160>> sarcolemma are then stimulated to elicit calcium ion release from <wd_idx<2170>> the sarcoplasmic reticulum . It is this chemical release that <wd_idx<2180>> causes the target muscle fiber to contract . </P> <Ul> <wd_idx<2190>> <Li> In invertebrates , depending on the neurotransmitter released and <wd_idx<2200>> the type of receptor it binds , the response in <wd_idx<2210>> the muscle fiber could be either excitatory or inhibitory . <wd_idx<2220>> </Li> <Li> For vertebrates , however , the response of <wd_idx<2230>> a muscle fiber to a neurotransmitter can only be excitatory <wd_idx<2240>> , in other words , contract", "<wd_idx<2220>> </Li> <Li> For vertebrates , however , the response of <wd_idx<2230>> a muscle fiber to a neurotransmitter can only be excitatory <wd_idx<2240>> , in other words , contractile . Muscle relaxation and <wd_idx<2250>> inhibition of muscle contraction in vertebrates is obtained only by <wd_idx<2260>> inhibition of the motor neuron itself . Muscle innervation may <wd_idx<2270>> eventually play a role in the maturation of motor activity <wd_idx<2280>> . This is how muscle relaxants work by acting on <wd_idx<2290>> the motor neurons that innervate muscles ( by decreasing their <wd_idx<2300>> electrophysiological activity ) or on cholinergic neuromuscular junctions , rather <wd_idx<2310>> than on the muscles themselves . </Li> </Ul> <H3> Special <wd_idx<2320>> visceral motor neurons ( edit ) </H3> <P> These are <wd_idx<2330>> also known as branchial motor neurons , which are involved <wd_idx<2340>> in facial expression , mastication , phonation , and swallowing <wd_idx<2350>> .

He is a lawyer and was once known as `` the deadliest shot in Maycomb County '' . Although he was a good shot , he does not like to mention the fact as he does not like the thought of having an advantage over people . He appears to support racial equality and was appointed to represent Tom Robinson , a black man who has been accused of raping a young white woman , Mayella Ewell . The town disapproves of him defending Tom especially when he makes clear his intent to defend Tom Robinson to the best of his abilities . He is portrayed by Gregory Peck in the film adaptation of To Kill a Mockingbird . </P> <H3> `` Scout '' Finch ( edit ) </H3> <P> Jean Louise `` Scout '' Finch is the narrator and To Kill a Mockingbird is told by an adult Scout who often comments on how she could not understand something at the time but now can appreciate it . She gets in trouble with her teacher Miss Caroline because Miss Caroline expects Scout to learn reading and writing her way . She is a tomboy and spends the most of her time with her brother Jem and best friend Dill . To Jem 's advice to pretend to be a lady and start sewing or something , she answers ' Hell no . ' The rare hints the narrator gives us about her grown - up life reveal that she ultimately has n't changed herself for others . </P> <P> She matures from age 6 to age 9 as the novel progresses but remains naive and idealistic , despite an increased understanding of human nature and racism in her town . At the beginning of the book , Scout is confused by some of the words and names she hears people directing towards her father , such as `` nigger - lover '' . Being only six , Scout does not know how to handle such situations so she tries to resolve her problems by fighting , or by talking to Atticus about what she has heard . By the end of the book , Scout realizes that racism does exist and comes to terms with its presence in her town . Scout also learns how to deal with others , including the Finch family housekeeper , Calpurnia , and her aunt , Alexandra . Scout is the only one of the novel 's primary three children ( Dill , Jem , and herself ) to see and speak to Boo Radley during the course of the novel and realize that he is harmless , despite her initial fear of him . She also stops a mob that is trying to lynch Tom Robinson by talking to the mob leader , Mr. Cunningham , about inviting his son , Walter , over for dinner . Mr. Cunningham then tells the other mob members to get back in their cars and leave them alone . The members listen , and Scout unintentionally saves Tom Robinson 's life . She is portrayed by Mary Badham in the film adaption of To Kill a Mockingbird . </P> <P> Notable quote : `` Until I feared I would lose it , I never loved to read . One does not love breathing . '' </P> <H3> `` Jem '' Finch ( edit ) </H3> <P> Jeremy Atticus `` Jem '' Finch is Atticus ' son and Scout 's older brother by four years . Jem matures greatly throughout the course of the novel , much more affected by events than Scout seems to be . Being four years Scout 's senior , Jem is seen to have a greater understanding of - and therefore greater difficulty in navigating - the obstacles thrown their way . Jem is seen explaining many things to Scout throughout the novel . Bob Ewell breaks Jem 's arm , subsequently resulting in it being shorter than it had been , in an attempt to protect his sister . He is portrayed by Phillip Alford in the film adaptation of To Kill a Mockingbird . </P> <H3> Dill Harris ( edit ) </H3> <P> Charles Baker `` Dill '' Harris is a short , smart boy who visits Maycomb every summer from Meridian , Mississippi , and stays with his Aunt Rachel ( Aunt Stephanie in the film ) . Dill is the best friend of both Jem and Scout , and his goal throughout the novel is to get Boo Radley to come out of his house . The children concoct many plans to lure Boo Radley out of his house for a few summers until Atticus tells them to stop . In chapter 5 of the novel , Dill promises to marry Scout and they become `` engaged '' . One night Dill runs away from his home in Meridian , arriving in Maycomb County where he hides under Scout 's bed . When she finds Dill , he tells both Scout and Atticus that he was chained to a wall in his father 's basement ; later , he confesses he actually ran away because he felt he was being replaced by his stepfather . Before Dill returned to Meridian after the summer , he went swimming with Jem at the Barker 's Eddy creek . Scout , unfortunately , was unable to participate , because both boys were swimming naked . </P> <P> Unlike Scout and Jem , Dill lacks the security of family support . He is unwanted and unloved by his mother and stepfather : `` They do get on a lot better without me , I can not help them any . '' As Francis ( a cousin of Jem and Scout ) says , `` He has n't got a home , he just gets passed around from relative to relative . '' Dill maintains he has no father ; he does n't know where his father might live , or if he will ever come back . He is played by John Megna in the film adaption of To Kill a Mockingbird . </P> <P> This character is believed to be based on author Truman Capote , a childhood friend of Harper Lee . </P> <H3> Calpurnia ( edit ) </H3> <P> Calpurnia , nicknamed Cal , is the Finch family 's African - American housekeeper , whom the children love and Atticus deeply respects ( he remarks in her defense that she `` never indulged ( the children ) like most colored nurses '' ) . She is highly regarded by Atticus . She is an important figure in Scout 's life , providing discipline , instruction , and love . She also fills the maternal role for the children after their mother 's death . Calpurnia is a mother herself and raised her son , Zeebo , to adulthood . Calpurnia is one of the few black characters in the novel who is able to read and write , and it is she who taught Scout to write . She learned how to read from Miss Maudie 's aunt , Miss Buford , who taught her how to read out of Blackstone 's Commentaries , a book given to her . Aunt Alexandra despised Calpurnia because Alexandra believed that Calpurnia was not a `` maternal figure '' for Jem and Scout , especially for Scout . </P> <P> Calpurnia is a member of the First Purchase M.E. African Church in Maycomb . While Scout always hears her speak proper English , she is surprised to learn that Calpurnia does not do so at church , especially with the uneducated members of the congregation . </P> <P> While everyone in the novel is filtered through Scout 's perception , Calpurnia in particular appears for a long time more as Scout 's idea of her than as a real person . At the beginning of the novel , Scout appears to think of Calpurnia as the wicked stepmother to Scout 's own Cinderella . However , towards the end of the book , Scout views Calpurnia as someone she can look up to , and realizes Calpurnia has only protected her over the years . She is played by Estelle Evans in the film . </P> <H3> Arthur `` Boo '' Radley ( edit ) </H3> <P> Arthur `` Boo '' Radley is a recluse in To Kill a Mockingbird . </P> <P> Maycomb children believe he is a horrible person , due to the rumors spread about him and a trial he underwent as a teenager . It is implied during the story that Boo is a very lonely man who attempts to reach out to Jem and Scout for love and friendship , such as leaving them small gifts and figures in a tree knothole . Scout finally meets him at the very end of the book , when he saves the children 's lives from Bob Ewell . Scout describes him as being sickly white , with a thin mouth , thin and feathery hair , and grey eyes , almost as if he were blind . During the same night , when Boo whispers to Scout to walk him back to the Radley house , Scout takes a moment to picture what it would be like to be Boo Radley . While standing on his porch , she realizes his `` exile '' inside his house is really not that lonely . </P> <P> Boo Radley 's heroics in protecting the children from Bob Ewell are covered up by Atticus , Sheriff Tate , and Scout . This can be read as a wise refusal of fame . As Tate notes , if word got out that Boo killed Ewell , Boo would be inundated with gifts and visits , calamitous for him due to his reclusive personality . The precocious Scout recognizes the danger : renown would `` kill the mockingbird '' . Boo Radley is a ghost who haunts the book yet manifests himself at just the right moments in just the right way . He is , arguably , the most potent character in the whole book and as such , inspires the other key characters to save him when he needs saving . </P> <P> After the Tom Robinson trial , Jem and Scout have a different understanding of Boo Radley . `` Scout , I think I 'm beginning to understand something . I think I 'm beginning to understand why Boo Radley 's stayed shut up in the house all this time ... it 's because he wants to stay inside . '' ( 23.117 ) Having seen a sample of the horrible things their fellow townspeople can do , choosing to stay out of the mess of humanity does n't seem like such a strange choice . </P> <P> When Boo finally does come out , he has a good reason : Bob Ewell is trying to murder the Finch children . No one sees what happens in the scuffle , but at the end of it , Ewell is dead and Boo carries an unconscious Jem to the Finch house . Finally faced with Boo , Scout does n't recognize him at first , but suddenly realizes who he is . Boo Radley is played by Robert Duvall in the film . </P> <H3> Judge John Taylor ( edit ) </H3> <P> Judge John Taylor is a white - haired old man with a reputation for running his court in an informal fashion and an enjoyment of singing and dipping tobacco . He is unimportant to the children until he presides over the Tom Robinson trial , in which he shows great distaste for the Ewells and great respect for Atticus . Because of the judge 's sympathies for Tom , Bob Ewell breaks into the judge 's house while the judge 's wife is at church . After the trial , Miss Maudie points out to the children that the judge had tried to help Tom by appointing Atticus to the case instead of Maxwell Green , the new , untried lawyer who usually received court - appointed cases . Judge Taylor knew that Atticus was the only man who would stand a chance at acquitting Tom , or at least would be able to keep the jury thinking for more than a few minutes . By doing this , Judge Taylor was not giving in or supporting racism . He is portrayed in the film by Paul Fix . </P> <H3> Miss Maudie Atkinson ( edit ) </H3> <P> Miss Maude `` Maudie '' Atkinson lives across the street from the Finch family . She had known the Finches for many years , having been brought up on the Buford place , which was near the Finches ' ancestral home , Finch 's Landing . She is described as a woman of about 40 who enjoys baking and gardening ; her cakes are especially held in high regard . However , she is frequently harassed by devout `` Foot - Washing Baptists '' , who tell her that her enjoyment of gardening is a sin . Miss Maudie befriends Scout and Jem and tells them stories about Atticus as a boy . It is strongly implied that she and Atticus have a more than platonic relationship . Also , she is one of the few adults that Jem and Scout hold in high regard and respect . She does not act condescendingly towards them , even though they are young children . During the course of the novel , her house burns down ; however , she shows remarkable courage throughout this ( even saying that she wanted to burn it down herself to make more room for her flowers ) . She is not prejudiced , though she talks caustically to Miss Stephanie Crawford , unlike many of her Southern neighbors , and teaches Scout important lessons about racism and human nature . It is important to note that Miss Maudie fully explains that `` it is a sin to kill a mockingbird '' , whereas Atticus Finch initially brings up the subject but does n't go into depth . When Jem gets older , and does n't want to be bothered by Scout , Miss Maudie keeps her from getting angry . Maudie is played by Rosemary Murphy in the film . </P> <H3> Bob Ewell ( edit ) </H3> <P> Robert E. Lee `` Bob '' Ewell is the main antagonist of To Kill a Mockingbird . He has a daughter named Mayella and a younger son named Burris , as well as six other unnamed children . He is an alcoholic , poaching game to feed his family because he spends whatever money they legally gain via government `` relief checks '' on alcohol . It is implied , and evidence suggests , that he was the one who abused his daughter Mayella , not Tom Robinson ( the African American man accused of doing so ) . Although most everybody in town knows that the Ewells are a disgrace and not to be trusted , it is made clear that Tom Robinson was convicted because he is a Negro whose accuser is white . Upon hearing of Tom 's death , Bob is absolutely gleeful , gloating about his success . After being humiliated at the trial , however , he goes on a quest for revenge , becoming increasingly violent . He begins by spitting in Atticus ' face , followed by a failed attempt to break into the home of Judge Taylor , then finally menacing Helen , the poor widow of Tom Robinson . Ewell later attempts to murder Jem and Scout Finch with a knife to complete his revenge . Fortunately , Boo Radley saves Jem and Scout and it is believed that he kills Ewell with the knife . Heck Tate , the sheriff , puts in the official report that Bob Ewell fell on his own knife and died after lying under a tree for 45 minutes . Ewell is played by James Anderson in the film . </P> <H3> Mayella Ewell ( edit ) </H3> <P> Mayella Violet Ewell , 19 , is the oldest of the eight Ewell children . Before the trial , Mayella is noted for growing red geraniums outside her otherwise dirty home in order to bring some beauty into her life . Due to her family 's living situation , Mayella has no opportunity for human contact or love . She eventually gets so desperate that she attempts to seduce a black man , Tom Robinson , by saving up nickels to send her siblings to go get ice cream so that Mayella can be alone with Tom . Her father sees this through a window and in punishment he beats her . Ewell then finds the sheriff , Heck Tate , and tells him that his daughter has been raped and beaten by Tom . At the trial , Atticus points out that only the right side of Mayella 's face is injured , suggesting a left - handed assailant ; Tom 's left arm is mangled and useless , but Bob Ewell is left - handed . When Atticus asks her if she has any friends , she becomes confused because she does not know what a friend is . During her testimony she is confused by Atticus ' polite speech and thinks that his use of `` Miss Mayella '' is meant to mock her . She testifies against Tom Robinson . Mayella is played by Collin Wilcox in the film . </P> <H3> Tom Robinson ( edit ) </H3> <P> Thomas `` Tom '' Robinson is an African - American who is put on trial for the rape of a white woman , Mayella Ewell . Atticus is assigned to defend him , and stands up to a lynch mob intent on exacting their own justice against him before the trial begins . Tom 's left arm is crippled and useless , the result of an accident with a cotton gin when he was a child . Atticus uses this fact as the cornerstone of his defense strategy , pointing out that the nature of Mayella 's facial injuries strongly suggest a left - handed assailant . Tom testifies that he had frequently helped Mayella with household chores because he felt sorry for her and the family 's difficult life - a statement that shocks the all - white , male jury . Despite Atticus ' skilled defense , the jury 's racial prejudices lead them to find Tom guilty . Atticus plans to appeal the verdict , but before he can do so , Tom is shot and killed while trying to escape the prison where he is being held . Tom Robinson is played by Brock Peters . </P> <H3> Aunt Alexandra ( edit ) </H3> <P> Alexandra Hancock ( n\u00e9e Finch ) is Atticus ' and Jack 's sister , married to James `` Uncle Jimmy '' Hancock . She has a son named Henry and a very spoiled grandson named Francis . Around the middle of the book , Aunt Alexandra decides to leave her husband at Finch 's Landing , the Finch family homestead to come stay with the Finches . Aunt Alexandra does n't consider the black Calpurnia to be a very good motherly figure for Jem and Scout ; she disapproves of Scout being a tomboy and wants to make Scout into a southern belle ( encouraging her to act more ' lady like ' ) . This is the cause of many conflicts between Scout and Alexandra throughout the course of the novel . However , as the trial progresses , Scout comes to see how much her aunt cares for her father and what a strong woman she is . This is especially evidenced by a tea party when Scout is horrified by the racism displayed , and her aunt and Miss Maudie help her deal with her feelings . By the end of the book , it 's clear that Alexandra cares very much for her niece and nephew , though she and Scout will probably never really get along . </P> <H2> Minor characters ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Jack Finch ( edit ) </H3> <P> John Hale `` Jack '' Finch is Atticus ' and Alexandra 's younger brother . ( He is about 40 , which is 10 years younger than Atticus . ) Jack smells like alcohol and something sweet , and is said that he and Alexandra have similar features . Jack is a childless doctor who can always make Scout and Jem laugh , and they adore him . He and Miss Maudie are close to the same age ; he frequently teases her with marriage proposals , which she always declines . Jack also has a pet cat named Rose Aylmer , who is mentioned during the Christmas visit . </P> <H3> Francis Hancock ( edit ) </H3> <P> Francis Hancock is the spoiled grandson of Aunt Alexandra . ( The son of her son , Henry Hancock . ) Every Christmas , Henry and his wife drop Francis at Finch 's Landing , which is the only time Scout and Jem see him . Francis lives in Mobile , Alabama , and is a bit of a tattle - tale . He gets along well with Jem , but often spars with Scout . One Christmas , Francis calls Atticus a `` n * * * * * - lover , '' as well as insisting that he was ruining the family and the likes , which infuriates Scout and causes them to get into a fight . Francis lies about his role in it , telling Uncle Jack that Scout started it by calling him a `` whore lady '' , and Jack therefore punishes Scout . However , she explains the full story and charitably persuades her uncle not to punish Francis about it , but to let Atticus think they had been fighting about something else ( although Atticus later discovers the truth ) . </P> <H3> Mrs. Henry Lafayette Dubose ( edit ) </H3> <P> Mrs. Henry Lafayette Dubose is an elderly woman who lives near the Finches . She is hated by the children , who run by her house to avoid her . Scout describes Mrs. Dubose as `` plain hell . '' A virulent racist , she calls Atticus a `` nigger - lover '' to his children 's faces , and Jem flies into a rage and ravages Mrs. Dubose 's camellia bushes . As a punishment , Jem is required to read to Mrs. Dubose each day for a month . As Jem reads , she experiences a fit of drooling and twitching and does not seem to pay any attention to the words . When an alarm rings , Jem is allowed to leave for the day . She extends the punishment for one extra week and dies shortly after letting Jem go for the last time . Atticus informs him that Mrs. Dubose was terminally ill and had become addicted to morphine . By reading to her , Jem had distracted her so that she could break the addiction . In thanks , she leaves him a candy box with a camellia flower in it ; Jem burns the box in anger , but is later seen by Scout admiring the flower . Atticus tells Jem that Mrs. Dubose was the bravest person he ever knew , and she was trying to teach Jem the importance of bravery and true courage to endure anything when the situation is hopeless , as in her morphine addiction . </P> <H3> Mr. Heck Tate ( edit ) </H3> <P> Mr. Heck Tate is a friend of Atticus and also the sheriff of Maycomb County . He believes in protecting the innocent although he does n't usually show it . When Tom has been locked in jail and a lynch mob turns up to kill him , the sheriff refuses to hand Tom over , instead dispersing the crowd . At the end of the book , the two men argue over whether Jem or Boo Radley should be held responsible for the death of Bob Ewell . Heck eventually persuades Atticus to accept the theory that Ewell accidentally fell on his own knife , thus saving the harmless , reclusive Boo from the public exposure of a criminal trial . </P> <H3> Mr. Braxton Underwood ( edit ) </H3> <P> Mr. Braxton Bragg Underwood is a news reporter and a friend of Atticus . He owns and also publishes The Maycomb Tribune . Being a racist , he disagrees with Atticus on principle . He also has a strong belief in justice , as exemplified when he defends Atticus from the Cunningham mob by having his double barrel shotgun loaded and ready to shoot them . He also demonstrates some humanity when he publishes a scathing editorial comparing the killing of Tom Robinson ( a cripple ) to `` the senseless slaughter of songbirds by hunters and children '' . </P> <H3> Mr. Horace Gilmer ( edit ) </H3> <P> Mr. Horace Gilmer is a lawyer from Abbottsville , and is the prosecuting attorney in the Tom Robinson case . Mr. Gilmer is between the ages of forty and sixty . Mr. Gilmer has a slight cast with one eye , which he uses to his advantage in trial . Mr. Gilmer appeared to be racist in his harsh cross-examination of Tom Robinson , but it is hinted at that he is in fact going easy on Tom . He and Atticus are not rivals and talk to each other during recesses during the case . </P> <H3> Dr. scott Reynolds ( edit ) </H3> <P> Dr. Reynolds is the Maycomb doctor . He is well known to Scout and Jem . Scout says that he `` had brought Jem and me into the world , had led us through every childhood disease known to man including the time Jem fell out of the tree house , and he had never lost our friendship . Dr. Reynolds said that if we were boil - prone things would have been different ... '' . He inspects Jem 's broken arm and Scout 's minor bruises after the attack from Bob Ewell under the tree . </P> <H3> Dolphus Raymond ( edit ) </H3> <P> Dolphus Raymond is a white landowner who is jaded by the hypocrisy of the white society and prefers to live among black folks . In fact , he has children with a black woman . Dolphus pretends he is an alcoholic so that the people of Maycomb will have an excuse for his behavior , but in fact he only drinks Coca Cola out of a paper bag to try to hide it . When Dill and Scout discover that he is not a drunk , they are amazed . He shows Scout how sometimes you can pretend to be someone you 're not so people will be more understanding of you . </P> <H3> Link Deas ( edit ) </H3> <P> Link Deas owns cotton fields and a store in Maycomb who employs Tom and later Helen because she does not get accepted by any other employers in the county due to Tom Robinson 's legal troubles . He announces to the court ( in defense of Tom ) at one point in the trial that he had n't `` had a speck o ' trouble outta him '' in the eight years Tom had been working for him , and gets sent out by Judge John Taylor for doing so . When Bob Ewell starts threatening Helen after the trial , Mr. Deas fiercely defends her and threatens to have Mr. Ewell arrested if he keeps bothering her . He is on Tom Robinson 's side during the trial and remains loyal to the family afterward . </P> <H3> Miss Caroline Fisher ( edit ) </H3> <P> Miss Caroline Fisher is Scout 's first grade teacher and is new to Maycomb , Alabama and its ways . She attempts to teach the first grade class using a new system which she learned from taking certain college courses ( Jem mistakenly refers to it as the `` Dewey Decimal System '' , which is really how library books are organized . ) . She is upset by Scout 's advanced reading capabilities and believes that Scout is receiving lessons from Atticus . She feels as though Scout is trying to outsmart and mock her . In an effort to standardize the class , she forbids Scout from reading with her father . Atticus asks Scout to step into Miss Caroline 's skin . However , he continues to allow Scout to read with him at night so long as she continues to go to school . Miss Caroline has good intentions but proves quite incompetent as a teacher . When Scout tells Miss Fisher that she shamed a student ( Walter Cunningham , Jr . ) by giving him lunch money , she raps Scout 's palms with a ruler ( a punishment unheard of in Maycomb ) . She is also very sensitive and gets emotionally hurt quite easily , as seen when she cries after Burris Ewell yells at her , `` Report and be damned to ye ! Ai n't no snot - nosed slut of a schoolteacher ever born c'n make me do nothin ' ! You ai n't makin ' me go nowhere , missus . You just remember that , you ai n't makin ' me go nowhere ! '' After the Burris Ewell incident , Miss Caroline is seldom seen and soon forgotten . </P> <H3> Reverend Sykes ( edit ) </H3> <P> Reverend Sykes is the reverend of the First Purchase M.E. African Church in Maycomb County . This is the church Tom Robinson attended . Reverend Sykes forces the congregation to donate 10 dollars for Tom Robinson 's family since at the time , Tom 's wife , Helen , was having trouble finding work . During the trial , when the courtroom was too packed for the children to find seats , Reverend Sykes lets the kids sit with him up in the colored balcony and even saves their seats for them . </P> <H3> Miss Stephanie Crawford ( edit ) </H3> <P> Stephanie Crawford is the neighborhood gossip who claimed that she saw Boo Radley from her bedroom standing outside of her cleaned window one night . Crawford is one of the first on the scene after a loud gunshot is heard behind the Radley house . Because she is the neighborhood gossip , it is unwise to think of anything that she says as true , because most of the time it is not true at all . She is a friend of Alexandra Hancock . She lets Miss Maudie live with her when Miss Maudie 's house burns down , supposedly in order to steal Miss Maudie 's Lane cake recipe . She is thrilled to pass on gossip to the kids about Boo Radley . She claimed to have witnessed Bob Ewell 's threatening Atticus at the Post Office corner as she was returning from the local Jitney Jungle grocery store . </P> <P> In the film she takes the place of Rachel Haverford and is now Dill 's aunt . </P> <H3> Miss Rachel Haverford ( edit ) </H3> <P> Miss Rachel Haverford is Dill 's aunt and the Finches ' next door neighbor . She drank neat whiskey heavily after seeing a rattlesnake coiled in her closet , on her washing , when she hung her negligee up . Even though she can be very hard to deal with , she truly does love her nephew . Her family name , in the legends of Maycomb County , is synonymous with jackass . She is also a Southern Belle . </P> <P> In the film , she is not a character and Miss Stephanie takes her place as Dill 's aunt . </P> <H3> Helen ( sophy ) Robinson ( edit ) </H3> <P> Helen Robinson is the wife of Tom Robinson . She is spoken about many times . She has three children . Employed by Link Deas following the death of her husband , she is repeatedly harassed by Bob Ewell when traveling to work . Upon learning of this , Deas threatens Ewell , forcing him to stop . She is an example of how one person 's actions can have an effect on a lot of people and she elucidates the hardships that surround the Tom Robinson case . </P> <H3> Nathan Radley ( edit ) </H3> <P> Nathan Radley is the brother of Arthur `` Boo '' Radley and another difficult character to understand in To Kill a Mockingbird . When the children try to catch a view of `` Boo '' late one night through a window , he shoots over their heads with a shotgun ( albeit thinking he was aiming at a black person ) . Nathan also cements up the knothole in which Arthur leaves little gifts for the children . On the other hand , he helps Miss Maudie by saving some of her belongings when her house is on fire . He is more present than his brother , but equally mysterious . </P> <H3> Jessie ( edit ) </H3> <P> Jessie is Mrs. Dubose 's black nurse . She is the woman who shoos the children out when Mrs. Dubose has her fits , and she seems to care enormously for Mrs. Dubose . When Jem is forced to stay reading to Mrs. Dubose , Jessie kindly leads Jem and Scout to the door when Mrs. Dubose 's alarm goes off . The rumors about Mrs. Dubose concealing a gun about her person involves Jessie ; the book says `` and even if Mrs. Dubose missed , her girl Jessie would n't '' . </P> <H3> Burris Ewell ( edit ) </H3> <P> Burris Ewell is a son of Bob Ewell and a younger sibling of Mayella Ewell as well as the first antagonist of the novel . Burris is described as being chiefly antagonistic of Little Chuck Little and his teacher Miss Caroline Fisher . He comes to the first day of school , but departs just as everyone else in his family does . Burris is also poor . He has live lice in his hair . Burris also scared his teacher Caroline Fisher . He behaves rudely when she tells him to go home , wash his hair , and come back clean the next day . He refuses , and a student explains to Miss Caroline that Ewell children do n't attend school . All they do is show up for the first day , get marked down on the register , and then they miss the entire school year until the first day of the next year . His famous quote was , `` Report and be damned to ye ! Ai n't no snot - nosed slut of a schoolteacher ever born c'n make me do nothin ' ! You ai n't makin ' me go nowhere , missus . You just remember that , you ai n't makin ' me go nowhere ! '' As of Scout 's first year of school ( the first grade ) , Burris has repeated the first grade three times . Burris is also like his father and is very belligerent . </P> <H3> Lula ( edit ) </H3> <P> Lula is an African - American woman with a dislike for white people . She does n't like the idea of Calpurnia bringing Atticus Finch 's children , Jem and Scout , with her to church and tells her so but is overruled by the other congregants . According to James Zeebo , Calpurnia 's son , Lula 's said to be , `` a troublemaker from way back , with fancy ideas and haughty ways . '' She 's threatened with being `` churched '' ( subjected to church discipline ) by Reverend Sykes . </P> <H3> Mrs. Grace Merriweather ( edit ) </H3> <P> Mrs. Grace Merriweather is the producer of the play in which Scout plays as a ham . She tells Everett that `` the ladies of the South Maycomb Alabama Methodist Episcopal Church are behind him one hundred percent . '' She is mostly known for her devotion to the church and is widely held as the most devout lady in Maycomb ; however , like many of her peers , she is very hypocritical and loves to gossip with all the other women . </P> <H3> Walter Cunningham , Jr ( edit ) </H3> <P> Walter Cunningham , Jr is a child who is almost as old as Jem but is in Scout 's class . He is too poor to even pay off a 25 - cent debt because the Great Depression hit his poor family hard . Walter is not only too poor but also his family is too proud to take any money . He is invited over to the Finches ' house once , after engaging in a fight with Scout , where he covers up all of his dinner with molasses , much to Scout 's vocal dismay . This teaches Scout a lesson in humility and compassion . </P> <H3> Walter Cunningham , Sr. ( edit ) </H3> <P> Walter Cunningham , Sr. is Walter Cunningham Jr. 's father . He appears only twice , once at the beginning of the story when he has to pay off the debt to Atticus ( Walter Cunningham Sr. was his client ) by giving him firewood , vegetables and other supplies . He also leads the mob that comes to lynch Tom Robinson the night before the trial . Only when Scout talks to him about his son and how much he owes to Atticus does he reconsider and call off the mob . Scout innocently shames him because Scout reminds him of all the things that Atticus has done for him and for Maycomb County . After the verdict is given in the trial , Atticus tells Jem that one of the Cunninghams had changed his thoughts about Tom and pleaded that Tom was not guilty to the jury . </P> <H3> Little Chuck Little ( edit ) </H3> <P> Little Chuck Little is a student in Scout 's first grade class who has the mindset of an adult . His real name is Charles . He is depicted as chiefly antagonistic of Burris Ewell . He is presented in the novel when Miss Caroline is frightened by Burris ' lice . He warned Miss Caroline that if Burris was n't released from class , he might try something that would put their classmates at risk . When Burris starts advancing on Little Chuck after his warning / veiled insult , Little Chuck 's hand moved to his pocket ( implying that he was going to pull out a knife ) while saying , `` Watch your step , Burris . I 'd soon 's kill you as look at you . Now go home . '' Scared by Little Chuck 's bravery and his implied knife , Burris retreats . From this we see , through the narrative view of Scout , his gentlemanly attitude and how it calms Miss Caroline down . Little Chuck may be even more intelligent than originally meets the eye , as he easily could have been bluffing about the aforementioned implied knife to scare Burris into retreating . </P> <H3> Mr. Dick Avery ( edit ) </H3> <P> Mr. Dick Avery is an overweight neighbor who tells Jem and Scout that dramatic changes in the weather are caused by disobedient and misbehaving children . After it snows , they build a snowman that resembles him . Mr. Avery can also be seen in the story pushing a mattress out of a window when Miss Maudie 's house catches fire . The kids , including Jem and Scout , always waited for him to do something interesting . For instance , Jem claims that one night he urinated from his front porch in an impressive arc . </P> <H3> Miss Gates ( edit ) </H3> <P> Miss Gates is a third grade teacher at Scout 's school who insists that America is n't prejudiced like Hitler 's Germany . Despite this , Scout has heard her say that the blacks need to be taught a lesson after Tom 's trial . </P> <H3> Eula May ( edit ) </H3> <P> Eula May is Maycomb 's most prominent telephone operator . She sends out public announcements , invitations , and activates the fire alarm . She announced the closing of schools when it snowed and announced the rabid dog that entered Maycomb . Also , Eula May knows everybody in the town because of her unique job . </P> <H3> Cecil Jacobs ( edit ) </H3> <P> Cecil Jacobs teases Scout and Jem at school . Scout almost gets into a fight with Cecil over the trial of Tom Robinson . Scout beats up Cecil Jacobs because he says Atticus is a `` Nigger Lover . '' He gives a current event on Adolf Hitler and later frightens Scout and Jem on their way to the Halloween pageant . He and Scout then pair up at the carnival . At the Halloween pageant afterwards , Cecil was a cow . He hints that black people are not as good as white people while talking about Hitler during current events . He also tends to take jokes too far . However importantly he shows how prejudice is passed on from parent to child . </P> <H3> Tim Johnson ( edit ) </H3> <P> Tim Johnson is a dog belonging to Harry Johnson ( a character in the book who is mentioned once but is never seen ) . He is infected by rabies in chapter 10 and goes mad , putting everyone in the town at risk . Atticus is forced to shoot Tim Johnson before he reaches the Radley House or attacks anyone . When Atticus shoots the dog , his excellent marksmanship is revealed to Scout and Jem ( his nickname used to be One - Shot Finch ) . The dog 's body is collected by Zeebo . </P> <H3> Simon Finch ( edit ) </H3> <P> Simon Finch is the founder of Finch 's Landing . He is referred to in the first chapter of the book , being a direct ancestor of Atticus . He is a Cornish Methodist , and emigrated from England to avoid religious persecution , landing in Philadelphia before settling in Alabama . He was married , with one son , six daughters . He is also an apothecary . </P> <H3> Maxwell Green ( edit ) </H3> <P> Maxwell Green is the new lawyer in town . He is normally the judicially - assigned defense attorney but Judge Taylor assigned Tom Robinson 's case to Atticus to give Tom Robinson a better chance . </P> <H3> Mr. X Billups ( edit ) </H3> <P> Mr. X Billups who is seen only once in the book , going to the trial , is described as a `` funny man '' . X is his name , and not his initial . He was asked repeated times what his name was until he signed it . X was the name he had been given when he was born because his parents marked his birth certificate with an X instead of a name . </P> <H3> The Barber sisters ( Miss `` Tutti '' and Miss `` Frutti '' ) ( edit ) </H3> <P> The Barber Sisters ( Miss Sarah , nicknamed `` Tutti '' and Miss Frances , nicknamed `` Frutti '' ) are maiden sisters who live in the only house in Maycomb with a cellar . They were originally from Clanton , Alabama ; and are rumored to be Republicans . Besides their Yankee ways , both sisters are deaf ( Tutti completely deaf ; Frutti uses an ear trumpet ) , and had a Halloween prank pulled on them by some `` wicked '' schoolchildren ( Scout claims she was not included ) who put all of their furniture in their cellar . </P> <H3> Mrs. gertrude Farrow ( edit ) </H3> <P> Mrs. Farrow is a lady in the missionary society who visits the Finch house occasionally . </P> <H3> Mr. Conner ( edit ) </H3> <P> Mr. Conner is mentioned early on in the book . He was locked in an outhouse by `` Boo '' Radley and his friends . After taking the teenagers to court , Mr. Conner accused them of `` disorderly conduct , disturbing the peace , assault and battery , and using abusive and profane language in the presence and hearing of a female . '' He added the last charge after claiming that the teens had `` cussed so loud he was sure every lady in Maycomb heard them . '' </P> <H3> Zeebo ( edit ) </H3> <P> Zeebo is Calpurnia 's eldest son . He is one of just four people in First Purchase Church who can read , so he is the vocal leader , leading hymns in the Negro First Purchase Church by `` lining , '' reading a line of verse and having the congregation repeat it . Calpurnia taught Zeebo how to read . He is also the garbage man of Maycomb , and took away the dead rabid dog , Tim Johnson . When a fellow church member , a woman named Lula , tries to make the children feel bad for attending church with his mother , Zeebo welcomes Scout and Jem with open arms . He is kind but very quiet . </P> <H2> References ( edit ) </H2> <Ol> <Li> Jump up ^ `` What Kids Are Reading : The Book Reading Habits of Students in American Schools '' , Renaissance Learning , Inc. , 2008 .

At the beginning of the novel , Scout <wd_idx<1770>> appears to think of Calpurnia as the wicked stepmother to <wd_idx<1780>> Scout 's own Cinderella .

It <wd_idx<1880>> is implied during the story that Boo is a very <wd_idx<1890>> lonely man who attempts to reach out to Jem and <wd_idx<1900>> Scout for love and friendship , such as leaving them <wd_idx<1910>> small gifts and figures in a tree knothole . Scout <wd_idx<1920>> finally meets him at the very end of the book <wd_idx<1930>> , when he saves the children 's lives from Bob <wd_idx<1940>> Ewell .

Because of the judge 's <wd_idx<2420>> sympathies for Tom , Bob Ewell breaks into the judge <wd_idx<2430>> 's house while the judge 's wife is at church <wd_idx<2440>> .

However , she is frequently harassed <wd_idx<2630>> by devout `` Foot - Washing Baptists '' , who <wd_idx<2640>> tell her that her enjoyment of gardening is a sin <wd_idx<2650>> . Miss Maudie befriends Scout and Jem and tells them <wd_idx<2660>> stories about Atticus as a boy .

Although most everybody <wd_idx<2970>> in town knows that the Ewells are a disgrace and <wd_idx<2980>> not to be trusted , it is made clear that <wd_idx<2990>> Tom Robinson was convicted because he is a Negro whose <wd_idx<3000>> accuser is white . Upon hearing of Tom 's death <wd_idx<3010>> , Bob is absolutely gleeful , gloating about his success <wd_idx<3020>> . After being humiliated at the trial , however , <wd_idx<3030>> he goes on a quest for revenge , becoming increasingly <wd_idx<3040>> violent . He begins by spitting in Atticus ' face <wd_idx<3050>> , followed by a failed attempt to break into the <wd_idx<3060>> home of Judge Taylor , then finally menacing Helen , <wd_idx<3070>> the poor widow of Tom Robinson .

Due to her family 's living <wd_idx<3210>> situation , Mayella has no opportunity for human contact or <wd_idx<3220>> love . She eventually gets so desperate that she attempts <wd_idx<3230>> to seduce a black man , Tom Robinson , by <wd_idx<3240>> saving up nickels to send her siblings to go get <wd_idx<3250>> ice cream so that Mayella can be alone with Tom <wd_idx<3260>> . Her father sees this through a window and in <wd_idx<3270>> punishment he beats her . Ewell then finds the sheriff <wd_idx<3280>> , Heck Tate , and tells him that his daughter <wd_idx<3290>> has been raped and beaten by Tom .

When Atticus asks her if she has any friends <wd_idx<3350>> , she becomes confused because she does not know what <wd_idx<3360>> a friend is . During her testimony she is confused <wd_idx<3370>> by Atticus ' polite speech and thinks that his use <wd_idx<3380>> of `` Miss Mayella '' is meant to mock her <wd_idx<3390>> .

Atticus uses this fact as the cornerstone <wd_idx<3500>> of his defense strategy , pointing out that the nature <wd_idx<3510>> of Mayella 's facial injuries strongly suggest a left - <wd_idx<3520>> handed assailant . Tom testifies that he had frequently helped <wd_idx<3530>> Mayella with household chores because he felt sorry for her <wd_idx<3540>> and the family 's difficult life - a statement that <wd_idx<3550>> shocks the all - white , male jury .

She gets in trouble with her teacher Miss Caroline because Miss Caroline expects Scout to learn reading and writing her way . She is a tomboy and spends the most of her time with her brother Jem and best friend Dill . To Jem 's advice to pretend to be a lady and start sewing or something , she answers ' Hell no . ' The rare hints the narrator gives us about her grown - up life reveal that she ultimately has n't changed herself for others . </P> <P> She matures from age 6 to age 9 as the novel progresses but remains naive and idealistic , despite an increased understanding of human nature and racism in her town . At the beginning of the book , Scout is confused by some of the words and names she hears people directing towards her father , such as `` nigger - lover '' . Being only six , Scout does not know how to handle such situations so she tries to resolve her problems by fighting , or by talking to Atticus about what she has heard . By the end of the book , Scout realizes that racism does exist and comes to terms with its presence in her town . Scout also learns how to deal with others , including the Finch family housekeeper , Calpurnia , and her aunt , Alexandra . Scout is the only one of the novel 's primary three children ( Dill , Jem , and herself ) to see and speak to Boo Radley during the course of the novel and realize that he is harmless , despite her initial fear of him . She also stops a mob that is trying to lynch Tom Robinson by talking to the mob leader , Mr. Cunningham , about inviting his son , Walter , over for dinner . Mr. Cunningham then tells the other mob members to get back in their cars and leave them alone . The members listen , and Scout unintentionally saves Tom Robinson 's life . She is portrayed by Mary Badham in the film adaption of To Kill a Mockingbird . </P> <P> Notable quote : `` Until I feared I would lose it , I never loved to read . One does not love breathing . '' </P> <H3> `` Jem '' Finch ( edit ) </H3> <P> Jeremy Atticus `` Jem '' Finch is Atticus ' son and Scout 's older brother by four years . Jem matures greatly throughout the course of the novel , much more affected by events than Scout seems to be . Being four years Scout 's senior , Jem is seen to have a greater understanding of - and therefore greater difficulty in navigating - the obstacles thrown their way . Jem is seen explaining many things to Scout throughout the novel . Bob Ewell breaks Jem 's arm , subsequently resulting in it being shorter than it had been , in an attempt to protect his sister . He is portrayed by Phillip Alford in the film adaptation of To Kill a Mockingbird . </P> <H3> Dill Harris ( edit ) </H3> <P> Charles Baker `` Dill '' Harris is a short , smart boy who visits Maycomb every summer from Meridian , Mississippi , and stays with his Aunt Rachel ( Aunt Stephanie in the film ) . Dill is the best friend of both Jem and Scout , and his goal throughout the novel is to get Boo Radley to come out of his house . The children concoct many plans to lure Boo Radley out of his house for a few summers until Atticus tells them to stop . In chapter 5 of the novel , Dill promises to marry Scout and they become `` engaged '' . One night Dill runs away from his home in Meridian , arriving in Maycomb County where he hides under Scout 's bed . When she finds Dill , he tells both Scout and Atticus that he was chained to a wall in his father 's basement ; later , he confesses he actually ran away because he felt he was being replaced by his stepfather . Before Dill returned to Meridian after the summer , he went swimming with Jem at the Barker 's Eddy creek . Scout , unfortunately , was unable to participate , because both boys were swimming naked . </P> <P> Unlike Scout and Jem , Dill lacks the security of family support . He is unwanted and unloved by his mother and stepfather : `` They do get on a lot better without me , I can not help them any . '' As Francis ( a cousin of Jem and Scout ) says , `` He has n't got a home , he just gets passed around from relative to relative . '' Dill maintains he has no father ; he does n't know where his father might live , or if he will ever come back . He is played by John Megna in the film adaption of To Kill a Mockingbird . </P> <P> This character is believed to be based on author Truman Capote , a childhood friend of Harper Lee . </P> <H3> Calpurnia ( edit ) </H3> <P> Calpurnia , nicknamed Cal , is the Finch family 's African - American housekeeper , whom the children love and Atticus deeply respects ( he remarks in her defense that she `` never indulged ( the children ) like most colored nurses '' ) . She is highly regarded by Atticus . She is an important figure in Scout 's life , providing discipline , instruction , and love . She also fills the maternal role for the children after their mother 's death . Calpurnia is a mother herself and raised her son , Zeebo , to adulthood . Calpurnia is one of the few black characters in the novel who is able to read and write , and it is she who taught Scout to write . She learned how to read from Miss Maudie 's aunt , Miss Buford , who taught her how to read out of Blackstone 's Commentaries , a book given to her . Aunt Alexandra despised Calpurnia because Alexandra believed that Calpurnia was not a `` maternal figure '' for Jem and Scout , especially for Scout . </P> <P> Calpurnia is a member of the First Purchase M.E. African Church in Maycomb . While Scout always hears her speak proper English , she is surprised to learn that Calpurnia does not do so at church , especially with the uneducated members of the congregation . </P> <P> While everyone in the novel is filtered through Scout 's perception , Calpurnia in particular appears for a long time more as Scout 's idea of her than as a real person . At the beginning of the novel , Scout appears to think of Calpurnia as the wicked stepmother to Scout 's own Cinderella . However , towards the end of the book , Scout views Calpurnia as someone she can look up to , and realizes Calpurnia has only protected her over the years . She is played by Estelle Evans in the film . </P> <H3> Arthur `` Boo '' Radley ( edit ) </H3> <P> Arthur `` Boo '' Radley is a recluse in To Kill a Mockingbird . </P> <P> Maycomb children believe he is a horrible person , due to the rumors spread about him and a trial he underwent as a teenager . It is implied during the story that Boo is a very lonely man who attempts to reach out to Jem and Scout for love and friendship , such as leaving them small gifts and figures in a tree knothole . Scout finally meets him at the very end of the book , when he saves the children 's lives from Bob Ewell . Scout describes him as being sickly white , with a thin mouth , thin and feathery hair , and grey eyes , almost as if he were blind . During the same night , when Boo whispers to Scout to walk him back to the Radley house , Scout takes a moment to picture what it would be like to be Boo Radley . While standing on his porch , she realizes his `` exile '' inside his house is really not that lonely . </P> <P> Boo Radley 's heroics in protecting the children from Bob Ewell are covered up by Atticus , Sheriff Tate , and Scout . This can be read as a wise refusal of fame . As Tate notes , if word got out that Boo killed Ewell , Boo would be inundated with gifts and visits , calamitous for him due to his reclusive personality . The precocious Scout recognizes the danger : renown would `` kill the mockingbird '' . Boo Radley is a ghost who haunts the book yet manifests himself at just the right moments in just the right way . He is , arguably , the most potent character in the whole book and as such , inspires the other key characters to save him when he needs saving . </P> <P> After the Tom Robinson trial , Jem and Scout have a different understanding of Boo Radley . `` Scout , I think I 'm beginning to understand something . I think I 'm beginning to understand why Boo Radley 's stayed shut up in the house all this time ... it 's because he wants to stay inside . '' ( 23.117 ) Having seen a sample of the horrible things their fellow townspeople can do , choosing to stay out of the mess of humanity does n't seem like such a strange choice . </P> <P> When Boo finally does come out , he has a good reason : Bob Ewell is trying to murder the Finch children . No one sees what happens in the scuffle , but at the end of it , Ewell is dead and Boo carries an unconscious Jem to the Finch house . Finally faced with Boo , Scout does n't recognize him at first , but suddenly realizes who he is . Boo Radley is played by Robert Duvall in the film . </P> <H3> Judge John Taylor ( edit ) </H3> <P> Judge John Taylor is a white - haired old man with a reputation for running his court in an informal fashion and an enjoyment of singing and dipping tobacco . He is unimportant to the children until he presides over the Tom Robinson trial , in which he shows great distaste for the Ewells and great respect for Atticus . Because of the judge 's sympathies for Tom , Bob Ewell breaks into the judge 's house while the judge 's wife is at church . After the trial , Miss Maudie points out to the children that the judge had tried to help Tom by appointing Atticus to the case instead of Maxwell Green , the new , untried lawyer who usually received court - appointed cases . Judge Taylor knew that Atticus was the only man who would stand a chance at acquitting Tom , or at least would be able to keep the jury thinking for more than a few minutes . By doing this , Judge Taylor was not giving in or supporting racism . He is portrayed in the film by Paul Fix . </P> <H3> Miss Maudie Atkinson ( edit ) </H3> <P> Miss Maude `` Maudie '' Atkinson lives across the street from the Finch family . She had known the Finches for many years , having been brought up on the Buford place , which was near the Finches ' ancestral home , Finch 's Landing . She is described as a woman of about 40 who enjoys baking and gardening ; her cakes are especially held in high regard . However , she is frequently harassed by devout `` Foot - Washing Baptists '' , who tell her that her enjoyment of gardening is a sin . Miss Maudie befriends Scout and Jem and tells them stories about Atticus as a boy . It is strongly implied that she and Atticus have a more than platonic relationship . Also , she is one of the few adults that Jem and Scout hold in high regard and respect . She does not act condescendingly towards them , even though they are young children . During the course of the novel , her house burns down ; however , she shows remarkable courage throughout this ( even saying that she wanted to burn it down herself to make more room for her flowers ) . She is not prejudiced , though she talks caustically to Miss Stephanie Crawford , unlike many of her Southern neighbors , and teaches Scout important lessons about racism and human nature . It is important to note that Miss Maudie fully explains that `` it is a sin to kill a mockingbird '' , whereas Atticus Finch initially brings up the subject but does n't go into depth . When Jem gets older , and does n't want to be bothered by Scout , Miss Maudie keeps her from getting angry . Maudie is played by Rosemary Murphy in the film . </P> <H3> Bob Ewell ( edit ) </H3> <P> Robert E. Lee `` Bob '' Ewell is the main antagonist of To Kill a Mockingbird . He has a daughter named Mayella and a younger son named Burris , as well as six other unnamed children . He is an alcoholic , poaching game to feed his family because he spends whatever money they legally gain via government `` relief checks '' on alcohol . It is implied , and evidence suggests , that he was the one who abused his daughter Mayella , not Tom Robinson ( the African American man accused of doing so ) . Although most everybody in town knows that the Ewells are a disgrace and not to be trusted , it is made clear that Tom Robinson was convicted because he is a Negro whose accuser is white . Upon hearing of Tom 's death , Bob is absolutely gleeful , gloating about his success . After being humiliated at the trial , however , he goes on a quest for revenge , becoming increasingly violent . He begins by spitting in Atticus ' face , followed by a failed attempt to break into the home of Judge Taylor , then finally menacing Helen , the poor widow of Tom Robinson . Ewell later attempts to murder Jem and Scout Finch with a knife to complete his revenge . Fortunately , Boo Radley saves Jem and Scout and it is believed that he kills Ewell with the knife . Heck Tate , the sheriff , puts in the official report that Bob Ewell fell on his own knife and died after lying under a tree for 45 minutes . Ewell is played by James Anderson in the film . </P> <H3> Mayella Ewell ( edit ) </H3> <P> Mayella Violet Ewell , 19 , is the oldest of the eight Ewell children . Before the trial , Mayella is noted for growing red geraniums outside her otherwise dirty home in order to bring some beauty into her life . Due to her family 's living situation , Mayella has no opportunity for human contact or love . She eventually gets so desperate that she attempts to seduce a black man , Tom Robinson , by saving up nickels to send her siblings to go get ice cream so that Mayella can be alone with Tom . Her father sees this through a window and in punishment he beats her . Ewell then finds the sheriff , Heck Tate , and tells him that his daughter has been raped and beaten by Tom . At the trial , Atticus points out that only the right side of Mayella 's face is injured , suggesting a left - handed assailant ; Tom 's left arm is mangled and useless , but Bob Ewell is left - handed . When Atticus asks her if she has any friends , she becomes confused because she does not know what a friend is . During her testimony she is confused by Atticus ' polite speech and thinks that his use of `` Miss Mayella '' is meant to mock her . She testifies against Tom Robinson . Mayella is played by Collin Wilcox in the film . </P> <H3> Tom Robinson ( edit ) </H3> <P> Thomas `` Tom '' Robinson is an African - American who is put on trial for the rape of a white woman , Mayella Ewell . Atticus is assigned to defend him , and stands up to a lynch mob intent on exacting their own justice against him before the trial begins . Tom 's left arm is crippled and useless , the result of an accident with a cotton gin when he was a child . Atticus uses this fact as the cornerstone of his defense strategy , pointing out that the nature of Mayella 's facial injuries strongly suggest a left - handed assailant . Tom testifies that he had frequently helped Mayella with household chores because he felt sorry for her and the family 's difficult life - a statement that shocks the all - white , male jury . Despite Atticus ' skilled defense , the jury 's racial prejudices lead them to find Tom guilty . Atticus plans to appeal the verdict , but before he can do so , Tom is shot and killed while trying to escape the prison where he is being held . Tom Robinson is played by Brock Peters . </P> <H3> Aunt Alexandra ( edit ) </H3> <P> Alexandra Hancock ( n\u00e9e Finch ) is Atticus ' and Jack 's sister , married to James `` Uncle Jimmy '' Hancock . She has a son named Henry and a very spoiled grandson named Francis . Around the middle of the book , Aunt Alexandra decides to leave her husband at Finch 's Landing , the Finch family homestead to come stay with the Finches . Aunt Alexandra does n't consider the black Calpurnia to be a very good motherly figure for Jem and Scout ; she disapproves of Scout being a tomboy and wants to make Scout into a southern belle ( encouraging her to act more ' lady like ' ) . This is the cause of many conflicts between Scout and Alexandra throughout the course of the novel . However , as the trial progresses , Scout comes to see how much her aunt cares for her father and what a strong woman she is . This is especially evidenced by a tea party when Scout is horrified by the racism displayed , and her aunt and Miss Maudie help her deal with her feelings . By the end of the book , it 's clear that Alexandra cares very much for her niece and nephew , though she and Scout will probably never really get along . </P> <H2> Minor characters ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Jack Finch ( edit ) </H3> <P> John Hale `` Jack '' Finch is Atticus ' and Alexandra 's younger brother . ( He is about 40 , which is 10 years younger than Atticus . ) Jack smells like alcohol and something sweet , and is said that he and Alexandra have similar features . Jack is a childless doctor who can always make Scout and Jem laugh , and they adore him . He and Miss Maudie are close to the same age ; he frequently teases her with marriage proposals , which she always declines . Jack also has a pet cat named Rose Aylmer , who is mentioned during the Christmas visit . </P> <H3> Francis Hancock ( edit ) </H3> <P> Francis Hancock is the spoiled grandson of Aunt Alexandra . ( The son of her son , Henry Hancock . ) Every Christmas , Henry and his wife drop Francis at Finch 's Landing , which is the only time Scout and Jem see him . Francis lives in Mobile , Alabama , and is a bit of a tattle - tale . He gets along well with Jem , but often spars with Scout . One Christmas , Francis calls Atticus a `` n * * * * * - lover , '' as well as insisting that he was ruining the family and the likes , which infuriates Scout and causes them to get into a fight . Francis lies about his role in it , telling Uncle Jack that Scout started it by calling him a `` whore lady '' , and Jack therefore punishes Scout . However , she explains the full story and charitably persuades her uncle not to punish Francis about it , but to let Atticus think they had been fighting about something else ( although Atticus later discovers the truth ) . </P> <H3> Mrs. Henry Lafayette Dubose ( edit ) </H3> <P> Mrs. Henry Lafayette Dubose is an elderly woman who lives near the Finches . She is hated by the children , who run by her house to avoid her . Scout describes Mrs. Dubose as `` plain hell . '' A virulent racist , she calls Atticus a `` nigger - lover '' to his children 's faces , and Jem flies into a rage and ravages Mrs. Dubose 's camellia bushes . As a punishment , Jem is required to read to Mrs. Dubose each day for a month . As Jem reads , she experiences a fit of drooling and twitching and does not seem to pay any attention to the words . When an alarm rings , Jem is allowed to leave for the day . She extends the punishment for one extra week and dies shortly after letting Jem go for the last time . Atticus informs him that Mrs. Dubose was terminally ill and had become addicted to morphine . By reading to her , Jem had distracted her so that she could break the addiction . In thanks , she leaves him a candy box with a camellia flower in it ; Jem burns the box in anger , but is later seen by Scout admiring the flower . Atticus tells Jem that Mrs. Dubose was the bravest person he ever knew , and she was trying to teach Jem the importance of bravery and true courage to endure anything when the situation is hopeless , as in her morphine addiction . </P> <H3> Mr. Heck Tate ( edit ) </H3> <P> Mr. Heck Tate is a friend of Atticus and also the sheriff of Maycomb County . He believes in protecting the innocent although he does n't usually show it . When Tom has been locked in jail and a lynch mob turns up to kill him , the sheriff refuses to hand Tom over , instead dispersing the crowd . At the end of the book , the two men argue over whether Jem or Boo Radley should be held responsible for the death of Bob Ewell . Heck eventually persuades Atticus to accept the theory that Ewell accidentally fell on his own knife , thus saving the harmless , reclusive Boo from the public exposure of a criminal trial . </P> <H3> Mr. Braxton Underwood ( edit ) </H3> <P> Mr. Braxton Bragg Underwood is a news reporter and a friend of Atticus . He owns and also publishes The Maycomb Tribune . Being a racist , he disagrees with Atticus on principle . He also has a strong belief in justice , as exemplified when he defends Atticus from the Cunningham mob by having his double barrel shotgun loaded and ready to shoot them . He also demonstrates some humanity when he publishes a scathing editorial comparing the killing of Tom Robinson ( a cripple ) to `` the senseless slaughter of songbirds by hunters and children '' . </P> <H3> Mr. Horace Gilmer ( edit ) </H3> <P> Mr. Horace Gilmer is a lawyer from Abbottsville , and is the prosecuting attorney in the Tom Robinson case . Mr. Gilmer is between the ages of forty and sixty . Mr. Gilmer has a slight cast with one eye , which he uses to his advantage in trial . Mr. Gilmer appeared to be racist in his harsh cross-examination of Tom Robinson , but it is hinted at that he is in fact going easy on Tom . He and Atticus are not rivals and talk to each other during recesses during the case . </P> <H3> Dr. scott Reynolds ( edit ) </H3> <P> Dr. Reynolds is the Maycomb doctor . He is well known to Scout and Jem . Scout says that he `` had brought Jem and me into the world , had led us through every childhood disease known to man including the time Jem fell out of the tree house , and he had never lost our friendship . Dr. Reynolds said that if we were boil - prone things would have been different ... '' . He inspects Jem 's broken arm and Scout 's minor bruises after the attack from Bob Ewell under the tree . </P> <H3> Dolphus Raymond ( edit ) </H3> <P> Dolphus Raymond is a white landowner who is jaded by the hypocrisy of the white society and prefers to live among black folks . In fact , he has children with a black woman . Dolphus pretends he is an alcoholic so that the people of Maycomb will have an excuse for his behavior , but in fact he only drinks Coca Cola out of a paper bag to try to hide it . When Dill and Scout discover that he is not a drunk , they are amazed . He shows Scout how sometimes you can pretend to be someone you 're not so people will be more understanding of you . </P> <H3> Link Deas ( edit ) </H3> <P> Link Deas owns cotton fields and a store in Maycomb who employs Tom and later Helen because she does not get accepted by any other employers in the county due to Tom Robinson 's legal troubles . He announces to the court ( in defense of Tom ) at one point in the trial that he had n't `` had a speck o ' trouble outta him '' in the eight years Tom had been working for him , and gets sent out by Judge John Taylor for doing so . When Bob Ewell starts threatening Helen after the trial , Mr. Deas fiercely defends her and threatens to have Mr. Ewell arrested if he keeps bothering her . He is on Tom Robinson 's side during the trial and remains loyal to the family afterward . </P> <H3> Miss Caroline Fisher ( edit ) </H3> <P> Miss Caroline Fisher is Scout 's first grade teacher and is new to Maycomb , Alabama and its ways . She attempts to teach the first grade class using a new system which she learned from taking certain college courses ( Jem mistakenly refers to it as the `` Dewey Decimal System '' , which is really how library books are organized . ) . She is upset by Scout 's advanced reading capabilities and believes that Scout is receiving lessons from Atticus . She feels as though Scout is trying to outsmart and mock her . In an effort to standardize the class , she forbids Scout from reading with her father . Atticus asks Scout to step into Miss Caroline 's skin . However , he continues to allow Scout to read with him at night so long as she continues to go to school . Miss Caroline has good intentions but proves quite incompetent as a teacher . When Scout tells Miss Fisher that she shamed a student ( Walter Cunningham , Jr . ) by giving him lunch money , she raps Scout 's palms with a ruler ( a punishment unheard of in Maycomb ) . She is also very sensitive and gets emotionally hurt quite easily , as seen when she cries after Burris Ewell yells at her , `` Report and be damned to ye ! Ai n't no snot - nosed slut of a schoolteacher ever born c'n make me do nothin ' ! You ai n't makin ' me go nowhere , missus . You just remember that , you ai n't makin ' me go nowhere ! '' After the Burris Ewell incident , Miss Caroline is seldom seen and soon forgotten . </P> <H3> Reverend Sykes ( edit ) </H3> <P> Reverend Sykes is the reverend of the First Purchase M.E. African Church in Maycomb County . This is the church Tom Robinson attended . Reverend Sykes forces the congregation to donate 10 dollars for Tom Robinson 's family since at the time , Tom 's wife , Helen , was having trouble finding work . During the trial , when the courtroom was too packed for the children to find seats , Reverend Sykes lets the kids sit with him up in the colored balcony and even saves their seats for them . </P> <H3> Miss Stephanie Crawford ( edit ) </H3> <P> Stephanie Crawford is the neighborhood gossip who claimed that she saw Boo Radley from her bedroom standing outside of her cleaned window one night . Crawford is one of the first on the scene after a loud gunshot is heard behind the Radley house . Because she is the neighborhood gossip , it is unwise to think of anything that she says as true , because most of the time it is not true at all . She is a friend of Alexandra Hancock . She lets Miss Maudie live with her when Miss Maudie 's house burns down , supposedly in order to steal Miss Maudie 's Lane cake recipe . She is thrilled to pass on gossip to the kids about Boo Radley . She claimed to have witnessed Bob Ewell 's threatening Atticus at the Post Office corner as she was returning from the local Jitney Jungle grocery store . </P> <P> In the film she takes the place of Rachel Haverford and is now Dill 's aunt . </P> <H3> Miss Rachel Haverford ( edit ) </H3> <P> Miss Rachel Haverford is Dill 's aunt and the Finches ' next door neighbor . She drank neat whiskey heavily after seeing a rattlesnake coiled in her closet , on her washing , when she hung her negligee up . Even though she can be very hard to deal with , she truly does love her nephew . Her family name , in the legends of Maycomb County , is synonymous with jackass . She is also a Southern Belle . </P> <P> In the film , she is not a character and Miss Stephanie takes her place as Dill 's aunt . </P> <H3> Helen ( sophy ) Robinson ( edit ) </H3> <P> Helen Robinson is the wife of Tom Robinson . She is spoken about many times . She has three children . Employed by Link Deas following the death of her husband , she is repeatedly harassed by Bob Ewell when traveling to work . Upon learning of this , Deas threatens Ewell , forcing him to stop . She is an example of how one person 's actions can have an effect on a lot of people and she elucidates the hardships that surround the Tom Robinson case . </P> <H3> Nathan Radley ( edit ) </H3> <P> Nathan Radley is the brother of Arthur `` Boo '' Radley and another difficult character to understand in To Kill a Mockingbird . When the children try to catch a view of `` Boo '' late one night through a window , he shoots over their heads with a shotgun ( albeit thinking he was aiming at a black person ) . Nathan also cements up the knothole in which Arthur leaves little gifts for the children . On the other hand , he helps Miss Maudie by saving some of her belongings when her house is on fire . He is more present than his brother , but equally mysterious . </P> <H3> Jessie ( edit ) </H3> <P> Jessie is Mrs. Dubose 's black nurse . She is the woman who shoos the children out when Mrs. Dubose has her fits , and she seems to care enormously for Mrs. Dubose . When Jem is forced to stay reading to Mrs. Dubose , Jessie kindly leads Jem and Scout to the door when Mrs. Dubose 's alarm goes off . The rumors about Mrs. Dubose concealing a gun about her person involves Jessie ; the book says `` and even if Mrs. Dubose missed , her girl Jessie would n't '' . </P> <H3> Burris Ewell ( edit ) </H3> <P> Burris Ewell is a son of Bob Ewell and a younger sibling of Mayella Ewell as well as the first antagonist of the novel . Burris is described as being chiefly antagonistic of Little Chuck Little and his teacher Miss Caroline Fisher . He comes to the first day of school , but departs just as everyone else in his family does . Burris is also poor . He has live lice in his hair . Burris also scared his teacher Caroline Fisher . He behaves rudely when she tells him to go home , wash his hair , and come back clean the next day . He refuses , and a student explains to Miss Caroline that Ewell children do n't attend school . All they do is show up for the first day , get marked down on the register , and then they miss the entire school year until the first day of the next year . His famous quote was , `` Report and be damned to ye ! Ai n't no snot - nosed slut of a schoolteacher ever born c'n make me do nothin ' ! You ai n't makin ' me go nowhere , missus . You just remember that , you ai n't makin ' me go nowhere ! '' As of Scout 's first year of school ( the first grade ) , Burris has repeated the first grade three times . Burris is also like his father and is very belligerent . </P> <H3> Lula ( edit ) </H3> <P> Lula is an African - American woman with a dislike for white people . She does n't like the idea of Calpurnia bringing Atticus Finch 's children , Jem and Scout , with her to church and tells her so but is overruled by the other congregants . According to James Zeebo , Calpurnia 's son , Lula 's said to be , `` a troublemaker from way back , with fancy ideas and haughty ways . '' She 's threatened with being `` churched '' ( subjected to church discipline ) by Reverend Sykes . </P> <H3> Mrs. Grace Merriweather ( edit", "reasoning": "This section explicitly mentions Calpurnia's son, providing the name Zeebo, which directly answers the question.", "id": 3, "begin_index": 600}, {"relevant_content": ", and using abusive and profane language in the presence and hearing of a female .
